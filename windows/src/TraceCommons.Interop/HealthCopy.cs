/// the sentence must not.</item>
/// <item><b>Always state the data consequence.</b> "Nothing has been lost",
/// "your queue is safe", "rather than going out unscanned".</item>

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This is a pure one-label-to-one-banner mapping and it must stay that way.
/// <c>status.health.last_error_label</c> carries a single label that the
/// daemon has already resolved through its own precedence order
/// (<c>daemon::health::precedence</c>: not-logged-in outranks the near-AI
/// notice, which outranks the self-test failure, and so on down). A client
/// that reconstructed that order would eventually disagree with the daemon
/// about what is wrong, and a contributor would be told one thing by the tray
/// and a different thing by the window. So this renders whichever label
/// arrives and never ranks, merges, or synthesises one. The Linux shell's
/// <c>render_health</c> carries the same note for the same reason.
