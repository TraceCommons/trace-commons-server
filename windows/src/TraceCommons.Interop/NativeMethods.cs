/// Raw P/Invoke declarations for the trace-commons-contributor-ffi C ABI.
///
/// This file is the hand-maintained mirror of
/// <c>macos/Sources/CTraceCommons/include/trace_commons.h</c>, which is itself
/// the hand-maintained mirror of
/// <c>crates/trace-commons-contributor-ffi/src/lib.rs</c>. All three change
/// together or not at all.
///
/// NOTHING outside <see cref="TcDaemon"/>, <see cref="TcPreview"/> and
/// <see cref="TcSubscription"/> may call into this class. That restriction is
/// what lets the ownership rules below be stated once and enforced in one
/// place, exactly as the Swift binding does it.
///
/// THREE MARSHALLING RULES, and every one of them is load-bearing:
///
/// 1. Owned returns are <see cref="IntPtr"/>, never <c>string</c>. Declaring a
///    <c>char*</c> return as a marshalled <c>string</c> makes the CLR free the
///    pointer with <c>Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem</c>, which is not the allocator
///    Rust used. That is heap corruption, and it is silent until it isn't. So
///    every owned return crosses as IntPtr and is converted with
///    <c>Marshal.PtrToStringUTF8</c> then released with
///    <see cref="tc_string_free"/>.
///
/// 2. Inputs are <c>LPUTF8Str</c>. The ABI is UTF-8 throughout; the .NET
///    default for <c>string</c> on Windows is UTF-16, and the "ANSI" fallback
///    is a lossy code-page conversion. A project label with a non-ASCII
///    character would arrive mangled.
///
/// 3. Borrowed returns (<c>const char*</c>) are also IntPtr, and must NOT be
///    passed to tc_string_free. The header's ownership rule is stated once
///    and is absolute: owned means returned <c>char*</c>, borrowed means
///    <c>const char*</c> and lives until its owning handle is freed.
