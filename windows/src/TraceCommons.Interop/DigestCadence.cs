/// stamping <c>last_digest_at</c> into persisted state so the spacing
/// survives a restart. The shell's job is only to render the
/// <c>digest_due</c> event it receives. This class is a second, in-process
/// backstop for the ways a shell can still over-notify with a
/// correctly-behaving daemon behind it: a resubscribe that replays, a
/// duplicate handler registration, a future caller that decides to post a
/// digest from somewhere other than the event. It never *causes* a digest --
/// it can only suppress one.

/// <para>
/// <b>Why claim-and-stamp is one call.</b> A separate <c>ShouldPost</c> and
/// <c>RecordPosted</c> pair can be got wrong in the direction that breaks the

/// again. <see cref="TryClaim"/> stamps as it answers, so the only way to be
/// told yes is to have consumed the window.
