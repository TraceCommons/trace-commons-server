/// the window or Settings, pauses/resumes watching, and asks to quit; the
/// balloon, when clicked, opens the window. That is the same rule the Linux tray
/// (<c>gtk/src/tray.rs</c>) and the Linux notifier (<c>gtk/src/notify.rs</c>)
/// hold: a surface reachable when the contributor is not looking at the
/// window gets the smallest possible vocabulary, because a misfire there
/// ships real transcripts and is unrecoverable.
