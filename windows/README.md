# The Windows contributor app

A WinUI 3 shell over the same `trace-commons-contributor-ffi` C ABI the macOS
app uses. It hosts the daemon in-process rather than shipping a second binary,
matching what `macos/` does and what the ABI was built for.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/TraceCommons.Interop/` | The C ABI binding. Targets plain `net8.0`. |
| `src/TraceCommons.App/` | The WinUI 3 shell. Targets `net8.0-windows`. |
| `tests/TraceCommons.Interop.Tests/` | Interop tests, including live ones against a real daemon. |
| `scripts/` | The GCE Windows dev box: provisioning, remote exec, screenshot capture. |
| `docs/dev-vm.md` | How to build, run, and see the app on that box. Read it before touching the WinUI half. |

### Why the interop layer is not a Windows project

`TraceCommons.Interop` deliberately targets `net8.0`, not `net8.0-windows`.
Nothing in it touches WinUI or WinRT — it is P/Invoke against a cdylib whose
filename .NET decorates per platform — so the same assembly and the same tests
run against a macOS `.dylib` or a Linux `.so` build of the identical Rust
crate.

That is what makes the risky half of this app testable without Windows.
Pointer ownership, UTF-8 marshalling, delegate rooting and the unsubscribe
barrier are all exercised on a developer machine, and CI then confirms the same
binding holds on Windows.

## Building and testing

The Rust cdylib must exist first; the app project fails its build if it is
missing rather than deferring that to a runtime error.

```bash
# From the repository root.
cargo build -p trace-commons-contributor-ffi            # debug, for the tests
cargo build -p trace-commons-contributor-ffi --release  # release, for the app

# Interop tests. These run on macOS and Linux as well as Windows.
dotnet test windows/tests/TraceCommons.Interop.Tests/TraceCommons.Interop.Tests.csproj

# The WinUI app. Windows only.
dotnet build windows/src/TraceCommons.App/TraceCommons.App.csproj -p:Platform=x64
```

`TC_FFI_LIB_DIR` overrides where the cdylib is looked for. It defaults to
`target/debug` for the tests and `target/release` for the app.

## Things the ABI requires that are easy to get wrong

All four are enforced in `TcDaemon`; they are listed here because each one
fails silently rather than loudly if a future change drops it.

1. **Owned returns must not be marshalled as `string`.** The CLR would free a
   `char*` return with `CoTaskMemFree`, which is not the allocator Rust used.
   Every owned return crosses as `IntPtr` and is released with
   `tc_string_free`.
2. **The subscribe delegate needs its own GC root.** Native code holding a
   function pointer does not keep the managed delegate alive. Both the delegate
   and the ctx box are rooted until `tc_unsubscribe` is *confirmed*.
3. **`tc_unsubscribe` refuses silently.** It returns `void` and declines when
   called from a thread inside any tokio runtime context, so success has to be
   inferred by comparing `tc_last_error` across the call. Assuming success frees
   ctx while callbacks can still fire.
4. **`tc_last_error` is thread-local.** An `await` between a failing call and
   the error read can resume on another pool thread and report nothing. Every
   read is on the calling thread with no await in between.

Teardown leaks rather than frees when it cannot prove the handle is idle. That
is deliberate and is not a bug to fix: the process is exiting, an unfreed handle
costs nothing, and a use-after-free is a crash or worse.

## A macOS-only test-harness trap

On Unix the daemon serves IPC over a unix domain socket inside its config
directory, and macOS caps `sun_path` at 104 bytes. A fixture using `$TMPDIR`
(48 characters on macOS) plus a nested folder and a 32-character GUID overruns
that cap once the socket filename is appended, and **every daemon start fails
with the opaque label `daemon-start-failed`** — nothing in the error points at
path length.

`NativeRoundTripTests.ShortTempDir` keeps the path short for this reason.
Windows is unaffected, since its transport is a named pipe.

## Packaging

The app ships as an MSIX built by single-project packaging, signed through the
same Azure Trusted Signing account the contributor CLI uses, and distributed
through a `.appinstaller` feed that Windows polls on its own schedule.

```powershell
# From windows/. Packaging is off by default; a plain msbuild is a compile
# check. dist/msix/ is the output directory.
msbuild src\TraceCommons.App\TraceCommons.App.csproj -restore `
  -p:Configuration=Release -p:Platform=x64 -p:TcPackaged=true
```

The package is deliberately unsigned at build time. `AppxPackageSigningEnabled`
is `false` because Trusted Signing holds no local key and the signature is
applied afterwards by `signtool` against a short-lived certificate issued to
the release job's OIDC token. There is no `.pfx` in this repository and there
must never be one.

Package identity is `Iqlusion.TraceCommons`, application id `App`. Both are
permanent: changing either produces a different app
that installs alongside the old one instead of updating it.

### Distribution

The release job publishes two objects to the public bucket:

| Object | Content type | Cache-Control |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `windows/<MSBuild-produced package filename>.msix` | `application/msix` | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |
| `windows/TraceCommons.appinstaller` | `application/appinstaller` | `no-cache, max-age=0` |

The package is uploaded before the feed, so there is never a window in which
the feed names an object that is not there yet. The feed is uncacheable on
purpose: a cached `.appinstaller` is a release nobody receives.

Contributors install once from
`https://storage.googleapis.com/tracecommons-flatpak/windows/TraceCommons.appinstaller`.
After that Windows checks the feed on app launch, at most once every 8 hours,
and again every 8 hours in the background whether or not the app was opened.
The app additionally surfaces a banner and an apply-now action, which drains
any in-flight upload before handing the update to the deployment service.

The app never replaces its own bytes. That is the same rule Homebrew, flatpak
and winget enforce on the other three paths.

## What is not here yet

Deliberately absent, and each is its own piece of work:

- Bulk withdrawal. This is a refusal rather than a gap, and it is the only
  affordance the shared design draws that this app states in words instead of
  drawing. `withdraw_bulk` reports only `withdrawn` and `failed` counts, so
  afterwards there is no per-trace tier to report — and the withdrawal
  contract's first rule is that no outcome may be reported as a generic
  "withdrawn". A bulk button could not honour it at any wording. The held
  group says so where a contributor would look for the button, and points at
  the per-row control that *can* tell them what it did.
- Stat-card glyphs. The design gives the week band and History's three cards a
  small icon each — a check in a circle, a clock, a set of columns. Neither
  screen draws them: this shell's stat card carries its tone in the border
  instead, and one screen introducing glyphs the other does not have would
  read as two designs rather than one. They belong in both cards or in
  neither.
- Persistent recent searches. The preview sheet remembers search terms for the
  life of the process and writes none of them to disk; the macOS shell persists
  its own. A recent search is the contributor's list of the things they are
  worried about leaking, so keeping it in memory is a deliberate narrowing
  rather than an omission.

## The tray and the interruption budget

The daemon controls digest timing through `digest_interval_secs`. Digests cover
waiting sessions and recent contributions; empty digests are suppressed. The
Windows shell adds a conservative four-hour backstop, so shorter configured
intervals may be suppressed. Neither gate creates notifications:

1. **The daemon.** `daemon/notify.rs::digest_due` refuses on an empty queue and
   otherwise fires once per `digest_interval_secs`, persisting `last_digest_at`
   so the spacing survives a restart. This is the shared policy every shell
   obeys; delivery is the `digest_due` subscription event.
2. **`TraceCommons.Interop.DigestCadence`.** A second, in-process gate for the
   ways a shell can over-notify with a correctly-behaving daemon behind it: a
   resubscribe that replays, a duplicate handler, a future caller posting a
   digest from somewhere other than the event. Claim-and-stamp is one call, so
   the only way to be told yes is to have consumed the window.

**Nothing reachable from the tray or a notification approves or sends
anything.** Clicking the icon or the digest raises the window; the menu can
open Review, pause or resume watching, open Settings, or ask to quit. Its
read-only rows summarize waiting projects, armed projects and the current
week. That is the same rule
`gtk/src/tray.rs` and `gtk/src/notify.rs` hold, for the same reason: a misfire
on a surface the contributor is not looking at ships real transcripts and is
unrecoverable.

The digest is a `Shell_NotifyIcon` balloon rather than a toast with buttons.
The spec's `[ Review ] [ Not now ]` becomes click-the-balloon and ignore-it;
`Not now` "does nothing but dismiss" anyway. A richer toast would add a
separate activation route, while the balloon keeps every action inside the
already-running process.

Quitting warns first, from the window's close button as well as from the tray.
On Windows the app HOSTS the daemon in-process, so quitting stops the watcher,
and the shared spec is explicit that saying the Linux sentence here would be
"a lie about whether the machine is still watching".

### Run at login

The Settings toggle is opt-in and `StartupRegistration` chooses exactly one
mechanism. The portable build writes
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` through `RunAtLogin`;
HKCU and never HKLM, because the app installs per user and needs no
administrator rights. The MSIX declares `TraceCommonsStartup` through the
`windows.startupTask` manifest extension and uses
`Windows.ApplicationModel.StartupTask` to read or change it. It never writes
the Run key from inside `WindowsApps`.

Both registrations appear in Windows' Startup Apps surface. If a contributor
disables the packaged task there, the API reports `DisabledByUser`; Settings
shows where to turn it back on and does not pretend that the app can override
the user's decision.

### What the tests cover, and what the VM confirmed

The mark's rasterization, the tooltip and digest wording, the icon-state
precedence, the cadence, and the Run-key value and quoting are all unit-tested
off Windows in `tests/TraceCommons.Interop.Tests/TrayTests.cs`.

The rest was confirmed on the dev VM (`docs/dev-vm.md`), because none of it is
reachable from a unit test. In an interactive session on Windows Server 2022:

- `Shell_NotifyIcon` accepted the icon, and all four states rendered through
  `MarkRaster` and `CreateIconIndirect` without a failed call.
- The mark reads correctly at 16px on a dark taskbar — single light ink, the
  user's bracket top left, the agent's answer bottom right, and the attention
  dot in the top-right quadrant both brackets leave empty.
- `TrackPopupMenuEx` drew the original short menu (disabled header,
  `Open Trace Commons`, the run-at-login toggle, `Quit Trace Commons…`) and
  returned cleanly when dismissed with Escape. The expanded menu still needs
  the same interactive VM pass.
- The digest arrived with the shared spec's wording, under the mark as its app
  icon.
- Writing the Run key made Windows raise its own "now configured to run when
  you log in" notification, which is the shell agreeing the entry is a real
  startup registration rather than an inert key. The value read back quoted,
  removal worked, and disabling twice was not an error.

Still unconfirmed: that either startup registration launches the app across a
real sign-in, and the interactive behaviour of the packaged startup consent
prompt.

## The health banner says only what the daemon said

The banner is rendered from `status.health.last_error_label` and nothing else.

That is a restraint rather than an economy. The daemon holds a precedence
order between conditions — `daemon/health.rs::precedence` ranks `not-logged-in`
above the NEAR AI notice, above the self-test failure, above the unreachable
labels — and it resolves that order itself, sending exactly one label. A client
that rebuilt the ranking would eventually disagree with the daemon, and so with
this app's own tray icon, about what is wrong. So `TraceCommons.Interop.HealthCopy`
is a flat one-label-to-one-banner table with no ordering in it at all, and the
view model stores whichever label arrived. The Linux shell's `render_health`
records the same rule; the macOS `HealthCopy` is the same table again.

Two copy rules from the shared design bind every sentence, and
`QueueFrameCopyTests` holds them to both: **never name the mechanism**
("privacy filter", "claim", "ingest", "canary" and "PII" are internal words),
and **always state the data consequence** ("nothing has been lost", "your queue
is safe", "rather than going out unscanned"). A label this build has never
heard of gets the sentence that is true of every blocking label; it is never
echoed back as the explanation, because a label is an internal name and
printing it would breach the first rule by the most direct route available.

The banner sits above both panes rather than inside the queue. The design draws
it on the queue because the queue is the only screen that frame draws; put
above the panes it says the same thing on every screen and never says it twice.
The Linux shell moved it for this reason and the note there says so.

Only two labels get an action button, because only two have one. The rest clear
on their own, and a button that cannot change the condition beside it teaches a
contributor that the buttons in this app do nothing — which they would then
believe about Undo.

## The week band reads the rollup the queue asks for itself

`history_rollup` backs both the History screen's stat cards and the queue's
week band, and each screen asks for it in its own refresh. That is deliberate
duplication of one cheap read: History's view is built lazily on first
navigation, so taking the figures from it would leave the band blank until
somebody clicked History. `App::refresh` in the Linux shell makes the same call
for the same reason.

Two of the three figures are weekly and the third is not. "In the commons" is
`all_time.accepted`, because it is a standing total — a weekly slice of it
would read as the commons shrinking every Monday, in exactly the place a
contributor looks for evidence that their work went somewhere.

## What arms Contribute

The preview sheet is the only surface in this shell that can approve anything.
Contribute is armed by `TraceCommons.Interop.ReadGate`, which now requires two
things: a pinned preview for the approval to bind to, and the consent
sentences themselves (`ReadGate.CanArm`). A build that cannot read the claim
must not take an approval against it.

It used to require two more — the redacted transcript having been on screen,
and an acknowledgement the contributor ticked themselves. Both came out as
friction. The macOS and Linux queues offer a per-row `Submit` that approves
with no preview opened at all, so the gate never stood between anybody and a
blind approval; it only charged a click to the contributor who chose to look.

What the checkbox asserted did not come out. All three shells now read that
sentence from one place — `crates/trace-commons-contributor/src/consent_copy.rs`,
across the C ABI as `tc_consent_copy` — and this shell prints it as plain text
above the buttons on every preview. It is asserted where it is defined; the
three shells no longer grep each other's sources for it. See
`ConsentSurface`/`ConsentCopy` here and
`tests/TraceCommons.Interop.Tests/ConsentCopyTests.cs`.

The rule lives in the interop assembly rather than in a view model because it
is the safety property of this shell, and there it is exercised on a machine
that cannot build WinUI at all.

## Withdrawal copy is contract, not UI text

History is backed by `list_history`, `history_rollup`, `refresh_history` and
`queue_outcome_counts`, and the one thing on it a contributor can *do* is
`withdraw`. That last one is the reason this section exists.

The three confirmation bodies are not this shell's to write. They are fixed in
`docs/contributor-daemon-ipc-v1_1.md` under "Canonical confirmation copy",
transcribed word for word into `TraceCommons.Interop.WithdrawCopy`, and
compared whole against that table by
`tests/TraceCommons.Interop.Tests/WithdrawCopyTests.cs`. The Linux shell holds
the identical constants in
`crates/trace-commons-contributor-gtk/src/copy.rs`; the two must not diverge.

**The tier is not knowable before the call.** The server computes
`distribution_reach` *during* the withdrawal, from live export membership, and
the confirmation has to be shown before that response exists. All this machine
holds is the record's local `status`, so:

| local status | shown before the call |
| --- | --- |
| `submitted`, `quarantined` | the `not_distributed` body alone — that is the server's own rule |
| `accepted` | **both** commons bodies, the distributed one weighted, and a sentence saying the outcome is decided on the server |
| anything else | the `commons_distributed` body alone — the furthest reach cannot be ruled out |

Afterwards the row reports the tier the server actually applied, using that
tier's body. Never a generic "withdrawn".

Two consequences worth knowing before touching this code:

- **A withdrawn record stays on the list and reads as withdrawn.** It is never
  dropped and never re-labelled as something that failed, and on success
  history is re-read rather than the row optimistically flipped. The tier the
  server applied is held per submission across that re-read, because
  `list_history` reports a status and never a tier — losing it would break the
  never-a-generic-withdrawn rule by way of a refresh.
- **`withdraw` currently always answers `account-session-required`.** The
  daemon holds a device key and never an account session, deliberately, so
  withdrawal survives losing the device that submitted the trace. That makes
  the failure path the one contributors actually hit, so it renders the whole
  explanatory sentence rather than a bare label — and, like every failure
  branch here, opens by saying nothing was withdrawn and nothing was deleted.

Everything above is decided in the interop assembly and tested off Windows.
What only a real Windows box can confirm is that the `ContentDialog` shows,
that the weighted body is visibly the heavier of the two, and that the nav rail
switches panes.

## Claiming a public handle

The rail's Settings row carries the device connection summary, startup,
daemon-provided consent scopes, the three watcher timing controls, per-project
ask/ignore controls, the local change log, and the public profile from section
5.6 of the shared design spec. The profile is backed by `get_public_profile`,
`set_public_profile` and `clear_public_profile`, all three of which were
already in the daemon's pinned `METHODS` array — the gap on Windows was never
protocol, only that nothing here asked.

Three things on it are contract rather than layout.

- **`handle_persisted` is not whether the claim worked.** By the time that flag
  exists at all the server has already taken the handle; it reports only
  whether the daemon managed to write its own local copy afterwards. So a
  claim with `handle_persisted: false` is reported as **published**, and the
  false branch adds only the weaker thing that is true — that this window will
  show the contributor as unlisted again until the next successful save, and
  that nothing about what is public changed. Telling someone their handle did
  not go up when it did is a false statement about an outward-facing act, and
  it is the one error this surface must never make.
  `PublicProfileCopyTests.AProfileThatWasPublishedNeverReadsAsOneThatWasNot`
  pins it as an invariant rather than as a string: both sentences must open
  "You're on the roster" and neither may contain the vocabulary of a refusal,
  so the copy stays free to be reworded and not to be reversed. The Linux
  shell asserts the same properties in `copy.rs`.
- **The claim is not gated on the local consent-scope list.** The server
  authorizes the `PUT` against the grant ceiling on the claim, not against the
  scopes this device happens to have recorded. The local set can be narrower
  than what the credential carries, so refusing here would refuse contributors
  the server would have allowed. The daemon makes the same choice explicitly,
  and so do the CLI and the other two shells.
- **The words are the Linux shell's, verbatim.** The shared design spec
  specifies the consent-scope checkbox and nothing else about this surface, so
  `crates/trace-commons-contributor-gtk/src/copy.rs` is the source of truth and
  `PublicProfileCopy` mirrors it — dashes included. macOS mirrors the same
  constants in `PublicProfileCopy.swift`. Two shells that word an
  outward-facing consent action differently are two different promises about
  what becomes public, so a change to one belongs in all three.

Going public keeps its acknowledgement gate: nothing is pre-checked, and
`Go public` stays disabled until the box is ticked and there is a handle to
claim. Leaving the roster is not gated, because it withdraws a consent rather
than granting one.

What only a real Windows box can confirm here is that the go-public
`ContentDialog` lays out its two columns, that a refusal keeps that dialog open
beside the field it is about, and that the rail's third row selects.
