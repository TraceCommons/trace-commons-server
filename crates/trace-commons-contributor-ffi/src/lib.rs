//! The C ABI for `trace-commons-contributor`'s background daemon.
//!
//! A native application shell (SwiftUI on macOS, WinUI on Windows, GTK on
//! Linux) hosts the daemon loop in-process rather than shipping and
//! notarizing a second binary. This crate is the seam: it wraps the existing
//! Rust daemon (`trace_commons_contributor::daemon`) behind a small `extern
//! "C"` surface callable from Swift via a bridging header and from C# via
//! P/Invoke, and it contains no logic of its own beyond that translation.
//!
//! # Ownership rule (stated once, obeyed everywhere)
//!
//! Every `char*` **returned** by this library is owned by the caller and
//! freed with [`tc_string_free`]. Every `const char*` is **borrowed** and
//! valid only until the handle that owns it (`tc_handle` or `tc_preview`) is
//! freed. There are no other lifetime rules anywhere in this crate.
//!
//! `tc_daemon_start` returns a `tc_handle*`; `tc_daemon_stop` tears the
//! running daemon down but does **not** free that pointer (a concurrent
//! `tc_call`/`tc_preview_open`/`tc_subscribe` on another thread stays valid
//! and simply observes the daemon as stopped, rather than dereferencing
//! freed memory); [`tc_handle_free`] is the only function that reclaims it,
//! and -- like every free function here -- must not be called concurrently
//! with any other call still using the same pointer.
//!
//! # Panic safety
//!
//! Every exported function wraps its body in [`std::panic::catch_unwind`]
//! via the [`guard`] helper. A Rust panic must never unwind across the FFI
//! boundary into Swift, C#, or C -- that is undefined behaviour on every one
//! of those callers. A caught panic becomes an ordinary error string, and
//! every step that follows catching it -- building that string, writing an
//! out-param -- is audited (see each such call site) not to itself panic,
//! so nothing after the `catch_unwind` boundary can defeat it either.
//!
//! # What never crosses this boundary
//!
//! No path, token, URL, or trace/session content appears in any error
//! string returned by this crate. The daemon's own hash-only / label-only
//! discipline (see the workspace root `CLAUDE.md`) applies here exactly as
//! it does at the socket: several of the daemon crate's own internal error
//! messages embed filesystem paths for CLI/local-stderr consumption (e.g.
//! `ConfigStore::open`, `daemon::start_embedded`'s lock-file context), which
//! is fine for that surface but not safe to forward verbatim across a
//! language boundary a GUI might log or display. [`guard`] therefore
//! discards the underlying `anyhow::Error`'s `Display` text by default and
//! substitutes a fixed label; [`guard_forwarding`] is the explicit,
//! documented-per-call-site opt-in for a closure every one of whose error
//! paths is already known to produce a fixed, safe label.
//!
//! ## The preview exemption
//!
//! [`tc_preview_body`] **is** trace content, and that is deliberate. It is
//! the single exemption to the rule above, and it exists because a
//! contributor cannot consent to sending something they cannot see -- an
//! approval given against a size and a project name is not an informed one.
//! The exemption is bounded, and the bounds are the whole point:
//!
//! * **Post-redaction only.** The body is whatever the real redaction
//!   pipeline produced; raw session text never reaches this boundary.
//! * **Only for an entry the caller already holds.** It is reachable only
//!   through a `tc_preview*` the caller opened for a specific `entry_id`;
//!   there is no bulk or ambient content read.
//! * **Never onward.** It is never written to a log line, an audit entry, a
//!   history record, notification text, or a receipt. Nothing in this crate
//!   or the daemon copies it into any of those.
//!
//! Opening a preview also has a **side effect at rest**: the daemon writes
//! the redacted envelope it just built into the contributor's own 0700
//! state directory (0600, atomic) and the upload then sends exactly those
//! bytes, so that what was shown here and what leaves the machine cannot
//! diverge through a privacy filter that does not reproduce its own output.
//! Those bytes are post-redaction, one file per previewed entry, capped by
//! the envelope size limit, deleted as soon as the entry resolves, and
//! removed on logout. They never come back across this ABI: the only
//! content this boundary serves is the body returned to the caller who
//! asked for it.
//!
//! Everywhere else the rule remains absolute: no path, token, URL, or trace
//! content in any other returned string, on any error path, at any time.
//!
//! Preview content is also held to a stricter rule than "no *raw*
//! path/token": [`tc_preview_open`] fails outright, rather than silently
//! editing the text, if the body contains a byte that cannot cross the
//! boundary as `char*` (a NUL) -- preview exists precisely so it can never
//! disagree with what an upload sends, and a silently-truncated-or-stripped
//! body would violate that guarantee without telling anyone.

// `tc_handle` / `tc_preview` are named to match the C header
// (`include/trace_commons.h`) and the Swift/C# callers that bind to it
// verbatim, not Rust naming conventions.
