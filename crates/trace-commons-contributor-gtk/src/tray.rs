//! `StatusNotifierItem`: a bonus, never a foundation.
//!
//! GNOME has no tray without a user-installed shell extension, and the
//! whole point of this platform's design is that the app must not depend
//! on one. So this module has exactly one job when there is no
//! `StatusNotifierWatcher` on the session bus: fail quietly and change
//! nothing else. There is no code path anywhere in this application that
//! tells a contributor to install an extension to get this back -- the
//! window already does everything the tray would.
//!
//! Where a watcher *is* real (KDE, Cinnamon, XFCE, GNOME with the
//! extension), this exports a minimal `org.kde.StatusNotifierItem` object
//! and registers it, with a `com.canonical.dbusmenu` menu beside it. The
//! icon does almost one kind of thing: a primary or secondary click raises
//! the window at its first screen, and a menu press raises it at the screen
//! that was pressed. `notify.rs`'s rule holds -- nothing reachable from
//! outside the window may approve or send anything.
//!
//! ## The one thing that is not navigation
//!
//! The menu can stop this computer answering model calls, and it cannot
//! start it. The two directions are not symmetrical and the menu's shape
//! says so: turning it OFF only ever reduces what this computer will answer,
//! so it is safe to press with nothing else on screen, while turning it ON
//! changes what anything else running here may send through, charged to the
//! contributor's own accounts. The sentence that says so is the reason model
//! calls became a screen of its own rather than a switch, and a menu press
//! that enabled it would route around that sentence. So the row says one of
//! two things and does one of two things: stop answering, or open the screen
//! where the switch and that sentence are side by side.
//!
//! This module still writes nothing itself. It asks, in the two words
//! [`TrayRequest`] has, and `ui::App` is what calls the daemon.
//!
//! The menu is generated from `ui::SCREENS` rather than listed here, so it
//! cannot offer a screen the window does not have, and every word in it is
//! the window's own. It is a shortcut in, never a second way to do
//! something: on plain GNOME there is no tray at all, so anything only
//! reachable from here would be unreachable for most contributors.
//!
//! ## The icon
//!
//! The icon is "The Turn", in the status-bar template variant the design
//! spec defines for exactly this position: frameless, a single ink, stroke
//! 8/64 so the brackets survive the loss of the frame at 14 and 16 px.
//! `ui::mark` is the only description of that geometry in the application;
//! this module serialises it rather than restating it.
//!
//! The `StatusNotifierItem` protocol names an icon, it does not carry one,
//! so the mark has to exist as a file somewhere the host can read. This
//! module writes a small icon theme of its own -- two SVGs and an
//! `index.theme`, under the application's data directory -- and hands the
//! host its root in `IconThemePath`. That is the protocol's own mechanism
//! for an application whose icon is not installed system-wide, and it
//! keeps us out of `~/.local/share/icons`, which belongs to the packaging
//! and to the contributor, not to a running process.
