//! The model-calls screen: whether this computer answers the model calls
//! made on it, and what the listener is actually doing.
//!
//! Its own destination rather than a card five sections down Settings. The
//! switch here is the one that makes this machine answer calls for whatever
//! else is running on it, and a contributor who has turned it on is owed a
//! place they can look at to see whether it is on right now.
//!
//! **Every sentence is read from `copy`**, which re-exports
//! `trace_commons_contributor::private_inference_copy` -- the same
//! definition the macOS and Windows shells reach across the C ABI. Nothing
//! here is authored in this view. The one word this surface may never say is
//! that the calls are private: turning this on does not make a call private,
//! it moves where the call is answered, and each call still goes on to
//! whoever was configured to answer it. The shared module carries the sweep
//! that enforces that; this view stays out of its way by never retyping a
//! sentence.
//!
//! **The indicator follows the tone, never the switch.** The switch shows
//! what was asked for; the tone -- and only `Clear` in it -- shows what is
//! true. A listener that refused to start leaves the switch on, and a screen
//! that painted a green dot from the boolean would be reporting a service
//! running that is not.
//!
//! **This window carries the whole capability.** GNOME has no tray (see
//! `ui/mod.rs`), so the tray entry beside this is only ever a shortcut in:
//! nothing on this screen may be reachable only from there.
//!
//! # The list leads, and the switch does not
//!
//! A tool is the unit a contributor can decide about. "Answer model calls at
//! all" is a consequence of connecting one, not a question to settle first,
//! so the tools on this computer are the first thing on the screen and the
//! switch below them is the kill switch.
//!
//! # Nothing is written that was not shown first
//!
//! Connecting a tool edits a file this app does not own. `harness_plan`
//! works the edit out and writes nothing; `harness_commit` takes a plan id
//! the daemon minted and nothing else, so this shell cannot construct a
//! write of its own. Between the two there is a dialog with the change in
//! it. A plan is single-use and expires, and a file that moved underneath
//! one is refused -- both are outcomes to report, not errors to retry.
//!
//! An occupied slot rides alongside whatever the outcome says, and is drawn
//! as what it is: a value the contributor put there, left exactly as they
//! had it. It is never an error to clear and never an offer to take over.
