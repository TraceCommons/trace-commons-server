//! The queue: what is waiting for a decision.
//!
//! The row carries what identifies a session to its author -- the project
//! label, the agent, when, and the redacted opening prompt -- plus what would
//! be sent and what scrubbing found, and now `Submit`: one click that builds,
//! pins, approves, and raises the toast `crate::toast` renders from the
//! response. `Contribute` in the preview sheet is still the only way to
//! *look* first -- `Submit` is the way to say yes without opening it, which
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-20-one-click-submit-design.md` adds
//! deliberately: the hold window and `Undo` are what make it safe rather
//! than a confirmation dialog.
//!
//! Every project with more than one session waiting gets the same gesture at
//! its header -- `Submit all` calls `approve` with `project_id`, never by
//! enumerating entry ids client-side, so "everything in this project" means
//! exactly what the daemon selects for it.
//!
//! Recovery lives here too, on the undo bar, rather than behind the sheet.
//! A toast takes the only path back with it when it fades; a bar on the
//! screen a contributor is already looking at does not.
//!
//! No filesystem path is ever rendered here. `project_label` is what a
//! contributor sees and `project_id` is what goes back to the daemon; the
//! path does not cross the socket at all, so there is nothing to leak.
