//! The roots screen: which session folders this shell may watch.
//!
//! It runs BEFORE the daemon starts, and therefore before any IPC exists.
//! That is why it is not one of the six onboarding screens in
//! [`super::onboarding`] -- every one of those is answered by a daemon call,
//! so none of them could ever clear a refusal that stops the daemon coming
//! up. Until this window existed the Linux shell answered an undeclared-roots
//! refusal by printing a label and calling `std::process::exit(1)`: the
//! process simply vanished, with nothing on screen saying why.
//!
//! ## Discovery is not consent
//!
//! [`trace_commons_contributor::source::discovery`] finds the conventional
//! stores and describes them -- where, whether they exist, how many sessions,
//! how recently touched -- so the question is "watch these 946 Claude Code
//! sessions?" rather than an empty text field. Nothing here starts selected.
//! A pre-ticked box plus a habitual Continue is the shape of consent people
//! click through, and it would recover most of the fail-open behaviour while
//! looking like it had asked.
//!
//! ## Why "I don't use this" is a button and not a blank
//!
//! Leaving a source unanswered does not mean "skip it". An unanswered source
//! is `None`, which the daemon reads as "watch the conventional location" --
//! so the answer a privacy-conscious contributor is most likely to give was,
//! before [`SourceDeclaration`], the one answer that scanned their work. The
//! button writes [`SourceDeclaration::Off`], which has no fallback.
