//! Onboarding: the six screens from the shared design spec.
//!
//! Until this existed the Linux app could not enrol anyone. It detected the
//! unenrolled state and said so -- [`copy::UNENROLLED_PREVIEW`] -- and then
//! offered no way to leave it, so an app-only contributor was stuck and had
//! to be sent to the CLI. macOS is the reference implementation
//! (`OnboardingCoordinatorView`); the copy for every shell is specified in
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-contributor-shell-shared-design.md`,
//! "## Onboarding".
//!
//! None of this is new protocol. Every method called here is already in
//! `daemon::ipc::METHODS`, and the GTK backend has been able to reach all of
//! them the whole time. What was missing was the window.
//!
//! ## Three things here are contract, not styling
//!
//! 1. **One failure sentence for the whole invite path.** `enroll` answers
//!    `enroll-failed` and never echoes the HTTP condition, so
//!    [`copy::ONBOARD_CONNECT_FAILED`] is shown whatever went wrong --
//!    including for an invite this app rejected before sending. Anything
//!    more specific would leak what the daemon withheld.
//!
//! 2. **Scope rows come from `consent_options`.** The list and the
//!    descriptions are the daemon's, never a hardcoded table here, so an
//!    operator who changes them changes what this screen says. Only the
//!    short title is mapped locally, and unknown scopes still render.
//!
//! 3. **`logged_in` is not "onboarded".** `enroll` flips it on screen 2,
//!    before consent is chosen on screen 3. Resuming on `logged_in` would
//!    drop someone who quit mid-flow into the main window carrying
//!    `enroll`'s floor-only default -- silently narrower consent than they
//!    were in the middle of choosing. Completion is recorded per tenant
//!    instead; see [`mark_complete`] and [`is_complete`].
