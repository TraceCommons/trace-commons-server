//! The one place this shell's visual decisions live.
//!
//! ## The direction: a customs declaration, not a feed
//!
//! This application stands between a developer's private transcripts and a
//! public research pool, and the only question its interface has to answer
//! is "what exactly is about to leave this machine, and can I stop it". So
//! the surfaces are built like a declaration form rather than a stream of
//! content: every session is one card, every card carries the SAME fields
//! in the SAME order, and each card ends in a fixed manifest strip set in
//! monospaced type.
//!
//! The repetition is the point. When every card's outbound facts land in
//! the same place, a person stops reading and starts scanning, and the row
//! that is different -- a large payload, a session where scrubbing matched
//! nothing -- is a break in a rhythm rather than a sentence they have to
//! notice. It is the one deliberately bold move in an otherwise quiet
//! window, and everything else is kept plain so it can carry.
//!
//! ## Family resemblance to the community site
//!
//! `community/public/styles.css` is the other face of this product. What is
//! carried across is the palette and, more importantly, the ROLES each
//! colour plays: green is primary and means "good standing", gold means
//! "weigh this", coral means "refused", blue means "held or ranked". Also
//! the warm off-white ground rather than a neutral grey, 6-8px radii with
//! pill badges, hairlines instead of shadows, and heavy uppercase micro
//! labels over data.
//!
//! What is deliberately not carried across: Inter is not bundled. A font
//! file is a real download and packaging cost for a brand cue, and the
//! site's 680/760/800 weights are reproduced on the system face, which is
//! what a Linux desktop's user has already calibrated their eye against.
//!
//! ## Overriding the GNOME accent, on purpose
//!
//! GNOME convention is that applications follow the user's chosen system
//! accent colour. This one does not: it pins the Trace Commons green. That
//! is a deliberate product decision, ruled on explicitly -- this window and
//! the community site are two faces of the same thing and a contributor
//! moving between them should not have to work out that they are, and the
//! accent here is also a role marker ("good standing"), not decoration.
//!
//! **This is not a bug. Please do not "fix" it back to
//! `AdwStyleManager`'s accent.** If it is ever reverted, it should be
//! reverted as a product decision, not as a theming cleanup.
//!
//! ## Dark comes from the design spec, not from an inversion
//!
//! The site has no `prefers-color-scheme` block anywhere, so there was no
//! dark palette to copy from it -- and on this platform dark is not
//! optional, since a large share of GNOME and KDE users run it permanently.
//! The dark values below are now the approved mockups' native palette
//! (`design-import/DESIGN-SPEC.md` §2.1) rather than this file's earlier
//! derivation, and they hold the same relations:
//!
//! * The ground (`#23251D`) is not a neutral grey; it keeps the warm green
//!   cast of the light ground (`#F6F7F4`) at the other end of the scale
//!   rather than the blue-black a naive inversion produces.
//! * ground / surface / inset keep the same order and roughly the same
//!   perceptual spacing as `--bg` / `--surface` / `--surface-2`.
//! * Every accent keeps its hue and its role and is lifted in lightness
//!   until it clears text contrast on the dark ground.
//!
//! ## Where the tokens come from
//!
//! Every `tc_*` colour below is one row of §2.1's native-palette table, and
//! the mapping is recorded inline. Two rows are deliberately absent:
//! `bg.sidebar.macos` and `bg.chrome.windows` are other platforms' chrome
//! and have no surface in this shell.
//!
//! ## Contrast is measured, never eyeballed
//!
//! Every ratio quoted below is a computed WCAG 2.1 relative-luminance
//! figure, not a judgement. The one that matters most is the filled primary
//! action. `--green` is tuned to be read ON the ground, not to be a fill
//! with a label on top of it: white on the site green measures 4.04:1
//! (below the 4.5:1 body-text floor) and white on the dark mint measures
//! 2.32:1 (below even the 3:1 large-text floor). That failure sits on
//! `Contribute` -- the one irreversible control in the product. So the fill
//! carries its own measured pair, and because libadwaita derives
//! `.suggested-action` from `accent_bg_color`/`accent_fg_color`, setting
//! that pair here fixes every suggested action in the window at once rather
//! than only the ones this pass happened to touch.
