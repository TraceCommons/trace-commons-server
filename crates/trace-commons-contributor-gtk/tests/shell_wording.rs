//! What this shell says, checked against its own source.
//!
//! Task 5 of the shell-copy slice moves the consent statement out of
//! `src/copy.rs` and into `trace_commons_contributor::consent_copy`, where
//! all three shells read it. The sweep below is what keeps the move from
//! half-happening: a re-export with the old literal still sitting beside it
//! compiles, passes every parity test, and renders the stale sentence on
//! this shell while the other two render the shared one.
//!
//! It lives here rather than in `copy.rs`'s own test module on purpose. A
//! sweep that reads the file it is written in also reads its own needles, so
//! the marker text inside the assertion would open a region that does not
//! exist. Reading the source from disk, from outside, is the only shape that
//! counts the real markers.
//!
//! The second half of this file counts, rather than sweeps: the wording
//! ratchet, the mirror of `ShellWordingTests.cs` on Windows and
//! `ShellWordingTests.swift` on macOS, for the same reason. A sentence
//! hand-written in one shell survives a rename in the other two, and until
//! this guard existed nothing here noticed.
