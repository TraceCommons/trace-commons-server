//! Self-serve invite claims for Celestine Sloth Society holders.
//!
//! A holder proves control of a Cosmos account with an ADR-036 `signArbitrary`
//! signature, and receives one invite code redeemable a fixed number of times.
//! This is the Cosmos twin of [`crate::near_legion_claim`]: same wire shape,
//! same refusal discipline, same grant shape, different chain.
//!
//! It is a parallel module rather than a generalisation of the Legion path on
//! purpose. The chains differ, the signature schemes differ, the address formats
//! differ, and the ownership queries differ; a shared abstraction would have been
//! a slug plus a chain-shaped enum, which is a switch statement with extra
//! indirection rather than reuse. What genuinely is shared is imported:
//! [`InviteGrantSink`], already generic over `policy_label`, and the
//! chain-agnostic plumbing in [`crate::claim_common`] -- environment reading,
//! the refusal encoding, and the CORS layer.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing and deliberately not application logic:
//!
//! - **One live grant per address** is the V42 partial unique index on
//!   `(policy_label, credential_binding_hash) WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`. A
//!   concurrent double-claim loses to Postgres, not to a check-then-act race.
//! - **The raw bech32 address is never stored.** It is recorded only as
//!   [`credential_binding_hash`], matching the site's stated privacy posture.
//!
//! The substantive improvement over the Legion path is the binding check. A
//! secp256k1 public key *is* the address:
//!
//! ```text
//! addr = bech32(hrp, ripemd160(sha256(compressed_pubkey)))
//! ```
//!
//! so proving possession of the key and proving control of the address are the
//! same act. There is no RPC that can fail closed here — only
//! [`ClaimError::PublicKeyAddressMismatch`], computed locally.
//!
//! The global cap is a soft bound: the count and the insert are not one
//! transaction, so concurrent claims can overshoot by the in-flight count.
