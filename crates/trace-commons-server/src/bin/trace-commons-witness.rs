//! `trace-commons-witness` — the redaction witness, served over HTTP.
//!
//! Runs inside a dstack TDX guest. It takes a raw transcript, redacts it,
//! reaches a residual-PII verdict with the same function ingest runs, and
//! signs a certificate over the redacted bytes with a key derived inside the
//! enclave. The server verifies that certificate without ever holding the raw
//! transcript.
//!
//! Two routes, and deliberately nothing else — see
//! [`trace_commons_server::witness_service::http`]. There is no health route
//! that reports state and no metrics route, because a witness that can be
//! asked what it has seen is not one that holds nothing.
//!
//! # This binary is thin on purpose
//!
//! Everything testable lives in the library: the router, the handlers, the
//! request bound, the nonce parser. What is left here is what cannot be
//! covered by a unit test — reading the environment, opening the dstack
//! socket, and binding a port. Anything that grows a branch worth asserting
//! on belongs behind `witness_service`, not here.
//!
//! # Boot is fail-closed
//!
//! Every dependency is resolved before the listener binds. A witness that
//! cannot reach the dstack agent, cannot derive its signing key, or cannot
//! read its own measurement exits non-zero at startup rather than accepting a
//! request it will refuse — the difference between an operator seeing the
//! failure and a contributor seeing it.
