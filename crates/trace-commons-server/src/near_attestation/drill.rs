//! The attestation drill: the one thing that makes the four verified pieces
//! mean something together.
//!
//! Each piece on its own proves less than it looks like it does.
//!
//! - A verified quote proves *a* TDX enclave running *a* measured image
//!   exists. It says nothing about the endpoint that answered us.
//! - A nonce inside that quote proves the quote is fresh rather than replayed.
//! - Pinned measurements prove the image is the one we reviewed.
//! - A verified receipt proves *some* key signed over a specific request and
//!   response.
//!
//! The join is the last step, and it is the one that is easy to leave out:
//! **the key that signed the receipt must be the key the quote attests.**
//! Without it a valid attestation and a valid receipt verify independently
//! and prove nothing together -- an endpoint can proxy someone else's genuine
//! attestation report while signing receipts with a key of its own, and every
//! individual check still passes. That substitution is the attack this drill
//! exists to catch, and
//! [`NearAttestationDrillStep::ReceiptSignerIsAttestedKey`] is where it is
//! caught.
//!
//! Two rules the drill holds that a verifier deliberately does not:
//!
//! - **TCB status must be `UpToDate`.** [`super::quote::verify_quote`]
//!   returns the status without enforcing it, which is right: a verifier
//!   returns data and policy belongs to the caller. This caller's policy is
//!   that anything else is a failure, named in evidence. There is no
//!   configurable allow-list, because an allow-list is the lever someone
//!   pulls to make a red drill green.
//! - **Nothing pinned is a failure, not a skip.**
//!   [`super::measurements::check_measurements_opt`] already returns
//!   `Refused`; the drill treats it as a failed step.
//!
//! **Evidence is hash-only.** Measurement registers, the TCB status and the
//! nonce are all public values and appear in full. The API key, the
//! completion text, the receipt and the signing address never do -- the
//! address appears only as a digest, and only so that two runs can be
//! compared.
//!
//! **Step 5 spends money**, so the drill refuses to reach it if any earlier
//! step failed. A completion against an endpoint we have not established is
//! the enclave we think it is buys nothing.
