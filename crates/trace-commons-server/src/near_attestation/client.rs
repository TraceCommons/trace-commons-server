//! The transport the attestation drill talks to, and its live implementation.
//!
//! Everything above this module is pure: [`super::AttestationReport`] parses,
//! [`super::quote`] verifies, [`super::measurements`] pins, and
//! [`super::receipt`] checks a signature. This module is the only part that
//! goes on the network, and it exists as a trait so the drill can be driven
//! end to end from a stub in tests.
//!
//! Four calls, in the order the drill makes them:
//!
//! 1. [`AttestationClient::fetch_report`] -- `GET {base}/attestation/report`.
//!    Deliberately **without** `include_tls_fingerprint`. In that default mode
//!    the quote's `report_data[0..20]` is the raw signing address and
//!    `[20..32]` are zero; with the flag set it is instead
//!    `SHA256(signing_address || spki_hash)` across all 32 bytes. NEAR AI's
//!    own README documents only the latter. The drill asserts the zero
//!    padding so that if this call ever grows the flag, the binding check
//!    fails loudly instead of quietly comparing an address against half a
//!    hash.
//! 2. [`AttestationClient::fetch_collateral`] -- Intel DCAP collateral for
//!    that quote. See the note on the cargo feature below.
//! 3. [`AttestationClient::complete`] -- one minimal chat completion. The
//!    caller supplies the request bytes and this method must put **those
//!    bytes** on the wire: the receipt binds `SHA256(request_body_as_sent)`
//!    and `SHA256(response_body_as_received)`,
//!    so a re-serialization here surfaces later as
//!    [`super::receipt::ReceiptError::RequestHashMismatch`], which reads as
//!    tampering rather than as the caller bug it would be.
//! 4. [`AttestationClient::fetch_receipt`] -- `GET {base}/signature/{chat_id}`.
//!
//! **Collateral fetching is behind the `near-attestation-collateral` cargo
//! feature, off by default.** `dcap-qvl`'s `report` feature is its collateral
//! client, and enabling it pulls a second async HTTP stack (reqwest 0.13)
//! into every build; nothing else in this workspace compiles that today. With
//! the feature off, [`HttpAttestationClient::fetch_collateral`] refuses with a
//! named missing control rather than silently degrading, so a default build
//! runs the drill and gets a red result explaining exactly what to rebuild.
//! Fetching the PCS endpoints by hand instead is not an option worth taking:
//! FMSPC extraction from the PCK leaf and CRL handling are precisely the
//! fiddly parts `dcap-qvl` already gets right.
//!
//! Errors here are hash-only. `dcap-qvl` error chains and reqwest errors both
//! quote URLs, and this crate's logs and audit rows never carry one.
