//! Attested inference, as a requirement the witness enforces.
//!
//! A witness certificate says an enclave redacted these bytes and reached this
//! verdict over them. It says nothing about where the transcript came from,
//! and nothing stops one being synthesised. A NEAR AI inference receipt is the
//! other half: it is signed by the inference enclave's key and binds
//! `SHA256(request_body_as_sent)` and `SHA256(response_body_as_received)`.
//!
//! This module is what lets a witness **require** one before it certifies
//! anything.
//!
//! # The transcript contains the bodies, so linkage is definitional
//!
//! The hard question about any receipt-carrying design is what binds a receipt
//! to *this* trace. Hashes bind a receipt to bodies; if the bodies were a
//! separate attachment, a contributor could attach any valid receipt they
//! could obtain, and every scheme for joining an attachment back to a
//! transcript is either a fuzzy rendering judgement or a check against an
//! assertion the contributor typed.
//!
//! This module joins nothing. **The raw bodies are part of the session the
//! witness was handed** -- a `TraceFile.http_exchanges` entry, carried through
//! `from_recorded_trace` into a
//! [`TraceContributionEventType::HttpExchange`] event whose
//! `structured_payload["request"]["body"]` is the request as sent and whose
//! `content` is the response as received. The witness reads those bytes out of
//! what it already holds and [`verify_receipt`] hashes them. There is one copy
//! of the bytes, the receipt binds them, and they are inside the material
//! being witnessed. Nothing is extracted, reassembled, or compared for
//! faithfulness.
//!
//! This also retires the objection that in-witness verification enlarges the
//! enclave's blast radius by shipping it raw HTTP bodies *in addition* to the
//! transcript. There is no addition: the enclave already holds exactly these
//! bytes, and it is the only party that does -- which is why it is the only
//! party positioned to verify at all.
//!
//! # The final call, chosen by the witness
//!
//! One body pair per trace, not one per turn. A chat-completions request body
//! repeats the whole conversation prefix, so per-turn bodies are O(N^2) in
//! session length -- and 7% of real sessions on this pilot already exceed the
//! 16 MB envelope cap at a 3.4:1 raw-to-envelope ratio.
//!
//! **Which call is attested is decided here, not by the caller.** The witness
//! takes the last `HttpExchange` event in the trace's own event order and
//! verifies the offered receipt against *that* exchange's bodies. A caller who
//! could nominate the exchange would nominate whichever one had a body that
//! suited them, and "the final call is attested" would be a claim about the
//! caller's choice.
//!
//! Two limits on that, both of which the certificate and every operator
//! surface must respect:
//!
//! - **Event order is the trace's own order.** The witness has no independent
//!   clock and no view of the session; a contributor who reorders events is
//!   describing a different session, and this module cannot tell. What it
//!   establishes is "the last inference call *this trace declares*".
//! - **Compaction breaks the transitive-coverage argument.** The reason one
//!   pair is worth having is that the final request body contains the
//!   conversation prefix -- true of an uncompacted linear session, false of one
//!   that summarised or truncated its context, and the witness cannot tell
//!   which it got. So nothing may say the attested call covers the history.
//!   The honest statement is about the bytes actually bound, and nothing more.
//!
//! Note what a later request does *not* give you: verifying the receipt for a
//! call needs that call's raw response body, and it cannot be recovered from
//! the next request body -- the receipt binds the raw HTTP response, not the
//! assistant message a later request quotes out of it.
//!
//! # Verification happens once, and cannot be repeated downstream
//!
//! The receipt binds the **raw** bodies; the witness emits a **redacted**
//! artifact. Redaction destroys the attested bytes -- that is what redaction
//! is -- so no party downstream of the witness can re-verify a receipt against
//! what it holds. This is inherent, not a gap to be closed.
//!
//! A witness that requires attested inference and issues a certificate anyway
//! is saying *a verified receipt was seen over the raw bytes at witness time*.
//! It is not saying the published artifact is attested, and nothing may imply
//! that a consumer can check it.
//!
//! # What it proves, exactly
//!
//! - An attested NEAR AI enclave produced this response for this request, and
//!   both bodies were inside the session that was certified, as its last
//!   declared inference call.
//! - It does **not** prove the session made the call. A contributor holding a
//!   receipt and its bodies can paste them into a trace they wrote. Closing
//!   that needs a capture-side change -- a nonce the contributor's identity
//!   determines, carried inside the request body, so the request hash commits
//!   to who called -- and nothing in any capture path sends one today.
//! - It says nothing about any other turn, tool result or file edit, and
//!   nothing about the conversation prefix (see compaction, above). An
//!   operator surface renders `n_of_m` and never "attested" or "genuine".
//! - It cannot detect a receipt replayed across two submissions. The witness
//!   holds nothing between requests by design. Dedup on the receipt signature
//!   belongs to ingest, which has state.
//!
//! # The attested bytes are not the bytes the harness sent
//!
//! The single most important sentence for anyone writing a surface on top of
//! this. The receipt binds **what the upstream provider received and
//! returned**, and on an IronWire route that is not the agent's own request:
//!
//! - a policy model swap re-serialises the request;
//! - the privacy filter re-serialises it wholesale, so the attested body holds
//!   filter **placeholders** where the original held real values;
//! - a cross-family route synthesises a different document entirely -- the
//!   attested request on a NEAR AI route may be a Chat Completions document
//!   built from an Anthropic one.
//!
//! And the attested response is the provider's own raw stream, not the frames
//! the client saw. Streaming is the normal case: NEAR AI's reference verifier
//! hashes the entire raw concatenated SSE text, so the response body here is
//! an event-stream document and **must not be parsed** -- reassembled content
//! would never hash to the same digest. Nothing in this module reads it; it is
//! bytes to be hashed.
//!
//! So the honest claim is *these are the bytes the provider hashed*, never
//! "this is the request the agent made". No wording anywhere may let a reader
//! assume otherwise.
//!
//! One consequence runs in our favour: because capture sits downstream of the
//! privacy filter, the attested bytes are already filtered.
//!
//! # Capture must be byte-verbatim, and a bad capture is indistinguishable
//! # from a forgery
//!
//! The sharpest edge in the design. `HttpExchange`'s bodies are `String`s, and
//! whether a capture put verbatim wire bytes there or a re-serialisation is a
//! capture-side question this module cannot answer. SHA-256 answers one bit:
//! these bytes are the bytes, or they are not. A capture that pretty-printed
//! the JSON, reordered its keys, or normalised a line ending produces the same
//! failure as a receipt lifted from somewhere else, and the witness **cannot**
//! tell them apart.
//!
//! So [`WitnessError::InferenceReceiptUnverified`] is named for what was
//! observed -- the receipt did not verify against these bytes -- and not for
//! any conclusion about why. On an honest deployment a capture bug is the
//! likelier cause, and an operator must read it that way.
//!
//! # A restarted stream is unattestable
//!
//! IronWire's resilience guard restarts a stalled stream, and a restarted
//! stream records no digest -- so no receipt exists for it, and none ever
//! will. Combined with attesting the final call, a trace whose **last** call
//! was restarted mid-stream can never satisfy the requirement. That is a
//! coverage hole rather than an edge case, and it gets its own name,
//! [`WitnessError::InferenceCallUnattestable`], so an operator is not left
//! reading it as a contributor who withheld a receipt.
//!
//! The witness recognises it from [`STREAM_RESTARTED_MARKER`] on the exchange.
//! That marker is a **contract the capture side must write**, not something
//! IronWire emits today; until it does, a restarted final call reaches an
//! operator as [`WitnessError::InferenceAttestationMissing`], which is
//! fail-closed but less informative.
//!
//! # The model, and which form of receipt binds it
//!
//! `verify_receipt` supports both forms of receipt text: the **two-part**
//! `<requestHash>:<responseHash>`, which binds no model, and the
//! **three-part** `{model}:{requestHash}:{responseHash}`, whose leading part
//! is covered by the signature.
//!
//! A hosted NEAR AI model returns the three-part form, so a real receipt names
//! its own model. That -- and only that -- is the model a pin is looked up by
//! below. The `model` query parameter on retrieval
//! (`GET /v1/signature/{chat_id}?model=...`) is not signed and is chosen by
//! whoever fetches the receipt, so it establishes nothing and is not read.
//!
//! An earlier version of this module asserted the provider signs only the
//! two-part form and concluded no model policy was possible. That was wrong
//! about the provider, and the pin built on that belief -- one provider-wide
//! gateway key -- could not have worked, because the signing key is per model.
//!
//! The model named in the attested request body is also hash-bound and is
//! read, but only as the value `verify_receipt` compares a three-part
//! receipt's bound model against; a mismatch surfaces as
//! [`WitnessError::InferenceReceiptUnverified`]. It is the model IronWire
//! asked for rather than the model that served, and on a policy swap those
//! differ -- so it is not what a pin is keyed by.
//!
//! # Who signed, not just that a signature verifies
//!
//! `verify_receipt` establishes that a well-formed signature over these bytes
//! checks out against the key the receipt itself names. Every key satisfies
//! that, the submitter's included -- so on its own it is a statement about
//! self-consistency, not about provenance.
//!
//! [`InferenceAttestationPolicy::pinning_model_keys`] is what turns it into
//! one. NEAR AI's attestation report binds an ed25519 signing key into a TDX
//! quote (`report_data == signing_address || nonce`), and the contributor
//! client compares a fetched receipt's signer against a freshly-nonced report.
//! A check the submitter runs on its own submission is not a bound: a patched
//! client skips it. The pin is the same comparison, made here, against keys
//! the operator configured.
//!
//! **Per model, and that is the correction.** An earlier version of this
//! pinned a single `gateway_attestation.signing_address`. That key signs no
//! receipt. A hosted-model receipt comes back `signature_kind:
//! "provider_tee"` with a signer that differs per model -- the key that
//! appears in the report's `model_attestations`, and only when the report was
//! requested with `signing_algo=ed25519`. One key therefore cannot match the
//! signer set, and the shipped pin refused every real receipt. The pin is a
//! map from model name to that model's attested key set, and the model is
//! read out of the **receipt's own text**, which is `{model}:{request_sha256}:
//! {response_sha256}`.
//!
//! Pins rather than a live report fetch, because this module makes no
//! outbound call on the request path and one that did would be trusting a
//! report fetched over a path an attacker able to substitute a signing key is
//! also positioned to influence. The operator derives the keys out of band
//! with a nonce-bound `signing_algo=ed25519` report; see
//! `deploy/witness/README.md`. And ed25519 only: the ECDSA signer is in no
//! ed25519 attestation, so an ECDSA receipt cannot satisfy a pin.
//!
//! Dormant when unset, and a pin failure folds into
//! [`WitnessError::InferenceReceiptUnverified`] with every other receipt
//! failure -- a label of its own would make an unauthenticated route an oracle
//! for the pinned keys.
//!
//! # Nothing here is logged
//!
//! Bodies, receipt text, signatures and signing addresses are all caller data.
//! Every refusal is a bare label with no count, no offset and no payload;
//! `ReceiptPayload` never reaches a `Debug` this module writes. The several
//! ways a receipt can fail to verify are deliberately folded into one label:
//! publishing which one occurred on an unauthenticated route would tell a
//! prober which of its guesses was closest.

/// the order is redact, strip, hash, sign; a digest taken before this ran
/// would name bytes nobody holds and every downstream verification would fail
/// as an artifact mismatch. There is a test for that ordering, because it is
/// the kind of mistake that looks right.
///
/// # Why the bodies go, rather than being kept for a second verifier
///
/// They are already worthless by the time they are here. The witness redacts
/// the session it is given, bodies included, so what survives the pass no
/// longer hashes to what the receipt binds -- a downstream party trying to
/// re-verify gets `RequestHashMismatch` and has no way to tell that from
/// tampering. The only way to keep them verifiable would be to **exempt them
/// from redaction**, which means shipping raw prompts and raw completions to
/// ingest and to storage. That is strictly worse than useless bodies.
///
/// So the third option is the right one: the bodies were only ever input to a
/// check that happens once, inside the enclave, over bytes only the enclave
/// ever holds. Once that check has run they have no reader, and an artifact
/// carrying them is carrying risk in exchange for nothing.
///
/// A consequence worth stating: the bodies never reach ingest or storage at
/// all, so the payload that would have pushed an attested trace past the
/// 16 MB envelope cap does not exist downstream.
///
/// # What is stripped, and what is not
///
/// The **body fields and the header maps**, not the event. Method, URL and
/// status are ordinary trace content and a consumer may legitimately want
/// them, so they stay.
///
/// Headers go with the bodies rather than staying with the method, and that is
/// a deliberate departure from "strip only the bodies". An inference request
/// carries its credential in `Authorization`, and this repository has already
/// measured that opaque bearer tokens are **not** reliably redacted -- the
/// deterministic detector does not match them. Keeping a header map here would
/// mean shipping a live token downstream under a function whose whole purpose
/// is to remove what should not travel.
///
/// # How much of this the redaction pass already did, measured
///
/// Most of it now, and it used to be "some of it, conditionally, and the
/// condition is a string a capture chose". `BROWSER_RULES` in
/// `trace-commons-protocol` drops `body` and redacts `headers` for any event
/// whose **tool name** contains `http`, `browser` or `web`, and a name
/// matching no profile at all used to run no structural rules whatsoever --
/// so an `HttpExchange` named `inference`, or whatever an IronWire capture
/// picked, kept its request body and its `Authorization` header all the way
/// through the pass. That fallback now falls closed: an unrecognised tool
/// gets the most restrictive profile rather than none.
///
/// This function is still not redundant, for three reasons. It **removes**
/// the fields rather than leaving `[REDACTED:...]` markers a reader has to
/// reason about, so nothing downstream can mistake a marker for evidence.
/// It runs before the digest, so the certificate covers the bytes the
/// contributor actually holds. And it is enforcement inside the enclave
/// rather than a classifier table two crates away, which is where a
/// guarantee of this kind should live. Deleting it is what
/// `the_returned_artifact_carries_no_inference_bodies_or_headers` fails on.
///
/// So the guarantee moves from "a classifier profile matched the tool name" to
/// "the witness removed them", which is where a guarantee should live.
///
/// # This is what makes refusal-only enforcement compose
///
/// The certificate carries no attested-inference field, because adding one
/// needs a v2 profile with its own signing domain and a flag day across three
/// implementations of the wire format. With the bodies stripped, that
/// limitation no longer touches the artifact: a certificate exists **if and
/// only if** attestation passed, since a requiring witness issues none
/// otherwise, and the artifact carries nothing a downstream reader could
/// mistake for re-verifiable evidence.
///
/// What it does **not** fix, and stripping does not make worse: a server still
/// cannot distinguish a requiring witness from a permissive one at the same
/// measurement. The measurement pins the image, not the environment, so the
/// measurement plus the deployment's configuration is now the entire basis of
