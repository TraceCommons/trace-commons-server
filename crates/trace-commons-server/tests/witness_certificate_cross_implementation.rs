//! The witness certificate has three independent implementations of one wire
//! format, and until this file existed nothing compared any two of them.
//!
//! - The **producer**: `witness_service::http`, which renders the certificate
//!   into two response headers and signs
//!   `WitnessCertificate::signing_bytes()`.
//! - The **server consumer**: `redaction_witness::request::witness_headers`
//!   plus `verify_witness_certificate`, which reads those headers off
//!   `POST /v1/traces`.
//! - The **client consumer**: `trace_commons_contributor`'s
//!   `verify_certificate`, which rebuilds the signing preimage from the wire
//!   fields with its own encoder, because the server's encoder is AGPL and
//!   unreachable from a permissive crate.
//!
//! Every one of them had a unit suite, every suite was green, and the flow was
//! nonetheless completely non-functional: the client rebuilt the preimage
//! big-endian where the server writes little-endian, and the server consumer
//! read a header name nothing sends, in an encoding nothing produces. Each
//! suite was written against its own side's spelling, so agreement between
//! sides was the one property none of them could observe.
//!
//! # Why this file is in the AGPL crate
//!
//! `trace-commons-contributor` is `MIT OR Apache-2.0` and ships inside
//! proprietary harnesses; `trace-commons-server` is `AGPL-3.0-or-later`.
//! Permissive code may flow into the AGPL crates and never the reverse, so a
//! test that needs both sides can only live on this one. The contributor crate
//! is a `[dev-dependencies]` entry here -- the direction `license_boundary.rs`
//! permits and pins -- and nothing shipped links across.
//!
//! # What each test would catch
//!
//! Nothing here re-spells the wire format by hand. Certificates come out of
//! the real router or the real `certificate_json`, signed by a real key over
//! real `signing_bytes`, and are handed to the real consumers. A fixture
//! spelled by the same author as the code under test agrees with whatever that
//! author believed, which is how all four drifts survived.
