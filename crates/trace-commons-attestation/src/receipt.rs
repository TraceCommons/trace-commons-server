//! Verification of a NEAR AI inference receipt.
//!
//! Quote verification (the server's `near_attestation::quote`) establishes
//! that the *endpoint* is a genuine Intel TDX enclave running an image we
//! pinned. That says nothing about any particular inference. A receipt is the
//! other half: alongside a completion, NEAR AI returns a short `text` carrying
//! the SHA-256 of the request body and of the response body, signed by the
//! enclave's signing key. Verifying it binds one specific request/response
//! pair to that key.
//!
//! The mechanism follows NEAR AI's own reference verifier
//! (`nearai/nearai-cloud-verifier`, `py/chat_verifier.py`):
//!
//! 1. `text` splits on `:` into two or three parts. With three, the hashes are
//!    `parts[1]` and `parts[2]` -- a leading part shifts them. With two, they
//!    are `parts[0]` and `parts[1]`.
//! 2. Both are SHA-256 hex: of the request body *as sent*, and of the
//!    **entire raw response body** as received.
//! 3. `signature` is an EIP-191 `personal_sign` over `text`:
//!    `keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(text) + text)`, then
//!    secp256k1 public-key recovery. The signer's Ethereum address is the
//!    last 20 bytes of `keccak256(uncompressed_pubkey[1..])`.
//! 4. The recovered address must equal `signing_address`, case-insensitively.
//!
//! Two places where this departs from that reference verifier, both settled
//! by a real captured triple rather than by reading:
//!
//! - The second hash is over the **whole response body bytes**, not over
//!   `choices[0].message.content`. Reading the parsed content instead is a
//!   verifier that always fails; against a thinking model whose `content` is
//!   `null` it does not even parse. `crates/trace-commons-server/tests/
//!   near_ai_live_receipt.rs` pins this against real bytes.
//! - The three-part form's leading part is the **model name**, not an opaque
//!   request identifier. The reference verifier discards it; this one checks
//!   it against the model the caller asked for, so the receipt binds the
//!   model as well as the bytes. A mismatch is
//!   [`ReceiptError::ModelMismatch`] -- a receipt for a completion some other
//!   model served, which is exactly the substitution nobody would otherwise
//!   notice.
//!
//! Two deliberate choices where this is stricter or looser than the prose:
//!
//! - The hash fields are compared as *decoded bytes*, so an upper- or
//!   mixed-case hex hash from some future provider build verifies rather than
//!   being refused as malformed. The comparison is still exact.
//! - The recovery byte is accepted in both encodings, 27/28 (Ethereum) and
//!   0/1 (raw ECDSA). A verifier that handled only one would reject valid
//!   receipts from a provider using the other, and that failure would only
//!   show up in production against live data we cannot replay.
//!
//! Nothing in this module may be logged. The `text`, the signature, the
//! signing address and the request and response bodies are all caller data;
//! errors here name a condition and carry no payload beyond a part count or a
//! recovery byte.
