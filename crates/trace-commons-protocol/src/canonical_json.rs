//! Key-ordered JSON for the paths whose bytes are hashed.
//!
//! `serde_json`'s `preserve_order` feature swaps `serde_json::Map` from a
//! `BTreeMap` to an insertion-ordered `IndexMap`. Cargo unifies features
//! across a build, so one dependency anywhere in the workspace that turns it
//! on silently reorders every `Value::Object` in every crate -- and with it
//! every digest taken over untyped JSON. That is not hypothetical: adding
//! `dcap-qvl` on a branch enabled it and moved a golden envelope digest in a
//! crate the branch never touched.
//!
//! These helpers make that ordering explicit rather than inherited, so the
//! hashing paths emit the same bytes under either backing map. Adopting them
//! moved no pinned digest, because under a `BTreeMap` each one is a no-op.
//!
//! **`preserve_order` is now on in some of this workspace's build graphs and
//! off in others, and that is fine.** `dcap-qvl`'s mandatory `std` feature
//! depends on `serde_json/preserve_order`, so any graph containing
//! `dcap-qvl` -- `cargo test --workspace`, or anything reaching
//! `trace-commons-server` -- resolves `serde_json::Map` to an `IndexMap`.
//! A graph without it -- `cargo test -p trace-commons-protocol`, or a
//! permissive crate built standalone -- still gets a `BTreeMap`. Run
//! `cargo tree -e features -i serde_json` to see which one a given build
//! has.
//!
//! That is the condition this module was written to survive, so it is not an
//! alarm to be raised; the invariant is that **every path whose bytes are
//! hashed routes through [`canonicalize`], so the ordering of the backing map
//! cannot be observed in a digest.** The split has a useful consequence:
//! sorting a `serde_json::Map` is unobservable under a `BTreeMap`, which used
//! to make this module's map-level tests vacuous, and under `preserve_order`
//! they are real. The same tests now run both ways in different CI jobs.
//!
//! Only untyped JSON needs this. A `#[derive(Serialize)]` struct is written
//! field by field in declaration order by the serializer, with no map in the
//! way, so routing one through [`canonicalize`] would *change* its bytes
//! rather than pin them. Do not.
