//! Listing the coding tools on this machine, and connecting them one at a
//! time.
//!
//! Almost nothing here is invented. `ironwire_agents::tools` already answers
//! "which tools does this machine have, and are they pointed at us", already
//! plans an edit before making it, and already carries the three rules that
//! make editing a file we do not own acceptable at all:
//!
//! - **Never rewrite a file we cannot parse.** A contributor's own syntax
//!   error must not come back looking like ours.
//! - **Fill an empty slot; leave a full one alone.** A value already in the
//!   key is another destination or a deliberate choice; it is reported, never
//!   overwritten.
//! - **Remove only what we put there.**
//!
//! This module carries those rules across the socket without letting a shell
//! route around them. In particular:
//!
//! # Plan and commit are two calls, and there is no third
//!
//! `harness_plan` works out the edit and writes nothing. `harness_commit`
//! takes a plan id and nothing else -- no tool id, no action, no port -- so a
//! shell cannot ask for a write it has not first been shown. There is
//! deliberately no method that does both. `ironwire_agents::Planned` keeps the
//! file contents it would write in private fields, so a plan cannot be
//! reconstructed from what crossed the socket either; it is held here, in this
//! process, between the two calls.
//!
//! # The file is re-read at commit
//!
//! A plan is worked out against the file as it was. `commit` writes the whole
//! file, so a tool that rewrote its own config in between would have that
//! rewrite silently reverted. The digest of the file as it was read at plan
//! time is kept beside the plan and checked again before the write; a file
//! that moved refuses with `harness-config-changed` and the shell plans
//! again.
//!
//! # Nothing from inside the contributor's file is logged or returned
//!
//! `changes` and `occupied` are IronWire's own words about slots and values,
//! and the occupied *values* are shown deliberately -- that is the whole
//! point of reporting rather than overwriting. Parse-failure detail is not:
//! serde and toml errors quote the offending line, so an unparseable file is
//! reported as a label and a path, never as its own contents.
