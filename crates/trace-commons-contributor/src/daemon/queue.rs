//! The pending queue: sessions that are ready to upload and waiting on the
//! contributor.
//!
//! The queue is durable because a notification is not. Someone who ignores a
//! digest, closes a window, or reboots must still find their pending traces
//! where they left them, and someone who never looks must not accumulate an
//! unbounded backlog.
//!
//! Three distinct ways of saying "no" coexist here on purpose, because they
//! answer different questions: `Ignore` is a standing decision about a project
//! (handled in `policy`), `dismiss` is a decision about one session, and
//! `Expired` is a record of inaction. Consumers render each differently.
//!
//! Expiry is suspended while the daemon is unhealthy. A privacy-filter outage
//! is not the contributor declining to upload, and letting a two-week clock
//! run through one would silently discard traces nobody chose to discard.
