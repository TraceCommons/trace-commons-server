//! clients draw.
//!
//! Two rules shape everything below.

//! found, a snapshot that cannot be parsed, a metric this daemon does not
//! recognize -- each of those produces *no standing at all* rather than a
//! partially-filled one. A zero or a dash inside this panel would be a claim
//! about someone's public standing that the daemon never received.
//!
//! **The reading is a record, never a currency.** Nothing here derives a
//! trend, a streak, a rank change, or a projection from the snapshot. The
//! daemon reports what the roster says and stops.
