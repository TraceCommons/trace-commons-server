//! The poll loop: stat the session roots, decide what is finished, and route
//! it by project policy.
//!
//! Polling rather than filesystem notification is deliberate. The quiescence
//! window is half an hour, so a sixty-second poll costs nothing in
//! responsiveness, and it avoids a watch dependency plus the per-platform
//! behaviour differences that come with one.
//!
//! Resolving a session's working directory means reading into the file, so
//! results are cached against the file's size and mtime. Without that cache a
//! laptop would re-read every session file every minute.
//!
//! The same reasoning governs the expensive step, `TraceSource::load`, which
//! reads, parses and hashes a whole session group. A session already sitting
//! in the queue is `Eligible` on every poll -- eligibility is decided from
//! prior *uploads*, and a `Pending` entry has never uploaded -- so the pass
//! used to load all of them, every minute, and throw the result away when
//! `replace_live_at_path` found the entry already tracked. It asks
//! `Queue::unchanged_offer_at_path` first now, comparing the whole
//! observation (group size and group mtime) against what the queue entry was
//! built from, and only loads when something moved.
//!
//! Two smaller per-poll costs were measured on the same corpus (81
//! claude-code groups over 1,044 files, 3,069 codex sessions, 11.7 GB) with
//! a release build, and only one of them was worth changing:
//!
//! - `source.discover()` walks both trees every tick. That is 4.9 ms for
//!   claude-code and 9.0 ms for codex once the head-peek memos are warm --
//!   14 ms of a sixty-second tick, 0.02% duty -- and 154 ms on the first
//!   pass of a process, when those memos are cold. It stats rather than
//!   reads, and the memos (capped at 8192 entries each) have room for
//!   several times this corpus. Left as a full walk: incremental discovery
//!   would have to keep its own view of which directories moved, and the
//!   failure mode of getting that wrong -- a session never noticed, or a
//!   subagent that lands under an already-seen session directory never
//!   noticed -- costs far more than the 14 ms it would save.
//! - `state.save()` at the end of the tick re-serialized and rewrote the
//!   whole `DaemonState` unconditionally: 1.24 MB, ~0.85 ms to serialize
//!   and ~6-10 ms to write and `fsync`, every sixty seconds, around 1.8 GB
//!   of writes a day, for bytes identical to the ones already on disk. That
//!   one is now elided when nothing moved; see `DaemonState::save`.
//!
//! The trajectory source is not watched: trajectory files have no
//! conventional local store to poll, so they stay a deliberate `submit
//! --trajectory` action.
