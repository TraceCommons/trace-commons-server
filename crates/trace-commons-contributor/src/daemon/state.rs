//! Watcher bookkeeping that has to survive a restart.
//!
//! Three things live here that cannot be derived from anything else:
//!
//! - **What we last uploaded per path.** Receipts are keyed by session hash,
//!   never by path, so nothing else on disk can answer "has this file been
//!   uploaded, and at what size?" -- the question bounded growth re-queue
//!   depends on.
//! - **The previous poll's size per path**, which is how a session still being
//!   written is told apart from one that is finished.
//! - **A working-directory cache**, because resolving a session's cwd means
//!   reading into the file, and doing that for every session on every poll is
//!   continuous disk churn on a laptop.
//!
//! Paths appear in this file and never leave it.
