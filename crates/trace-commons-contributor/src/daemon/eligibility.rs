//! When is a local session finished enough to offer for upload?
//!
//! Neither Claude Code nor Codex writes an end-of-session marker, so the
//! daemon infers one. A session counts as finished when it has gone quiet for
//! the quiescence window *and* its size held steady across two consecutive
//! polls. The second condition matters because mtime granularity and clock
//! skew both lie, while a changing byte count does not.
//!
//! Re-uploading a grown session is deliberately bounded. The session hash
//! covers the whole file, so every re-upload re-sends all prior content: it
//! pays the privacy-filter bill again over the same text, and produces
//! near-identical envelopes that server-side duplicate clustering collapses,
//! diluting the contributor's own credit. So growth must be material, and it
//! can only happen a few times per session.
//!
//! Pure functions only. Everything here is decided from a stat result.

///
/// Thirty minutes is right for offering: the entry lands in the queue, a
/// contributor reads the preview whenever they next look, and they are the
/// last check. Thirty minutes of quiet is a lunch break, a meeting, or a
/// commute -- extremely common mid-session -- and under review that costs
/// nothing, because the human sees a half-finished trace and can decline it.
///
/// With nobody looking it costs a great deal. The session resumes, grows,
/// and takes the re-upload path: each re-upload re-sends the *whole* file,
/// pays the privacy filter again over the same text, and produces
/// near-identical envelopes that server-side duplicate clustering collapses
/// -- diluting the contributor's own credit. `max_reuploads` is 3, so it is
/// also a budget that premature sending burns.
///
/// A day rather than half of one because the commonest long pause is an
/// evening finish resumed the next morning. Twelve hours sends a session
/// last written at 6pm at 6am, just before a 9am resume -- long enough to
/// feel safe and short enough to lose exactly that case. Twenty-four hours
/// does not: the resume rewrites the file and restarts this clock.
///
/// Nothing is lost by waiting. An entry held here sits in the queue, and a
/// session that grows while it waits is handled by `Queue::supersede`, which
/// costs no re-upload budget and no duplicate penalty at all. Holding turns
/// the expensive path into the free one.
///
/// What this delays is a *session*, not the arming. The clock is each
/// observation's own `modified_at`, so arming a project whose sessions have
/// already been quiet for a day approves that backlog on the next poll --
/// there is no cool-off on the decision itself. Only sessions still being
/// written wait. `ProjectPolicy` does record the arming instant if a
/// cool-off on the decision is ever wanted; nothing reads it for that today.
///
/// Neither input is enforceable against the contributor: `now` is the wall
/// clock and `modified_at` is the file's own mtime, so one `touch -d` or one
