//! Claude Code transcript adapter.
//!
//! Reads `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl` session files and
//! maps them into the shared `SessionTranscript` model. See
//! `docs/superpowers/plans/` (Task 7) for the format facts and mapping
//! rules; `Opaque` events carry only a record-type marker and never a
//! payload. Reasoning (`thinking`) blocks are captured as `Reasoning`
//! events and redacted like any other content.
//!
//! # Subagent grouping
//!
//! A conversation is not one file. Claude Code writes each delegated
//! subagent's turns to `<project>/<session-uuid>/subagents/<agent>.jsonl`,
//! beside the top-level `<project>/<session-uuid>.jsonl`. On one probed
//! machine that was 842 subagent transcripts against 69 actual
//! conversations -- 911 files, one group of which had 114 members.
//!
//! Those 842 were previously discovered as sessions in their own right,
//! which was wrong twice over. It put 911 cards in a queue that describes
//! 69 conversations, and a subagent transcript misrepresents itself: its
//! opening prompt was written by the *parent agent*, and the queue card
//! renders the first user message as `opening_prompt`, so a contributor
//! read a machine-written instruction as if it were their own.
//!
//! So `discover` emits one `SessionRef` per top-level session and `load`
//! merges the parent with every member of its `subagents/` directory into a
//! single `SessionTranscript`. The rules that keep that honest:
//!
//! - **Membership is the directory**, verified by `sessionId`. All 842
//!   members agreed with their grandparent directory name; a member that
//!   disagrees is a format change or a planted file, and everything
//!   discovered here is a candidate for upload, so it is excluded and
//!   counted rather than trusted. A member with no `sessionId` at all is
//!   included -- absence is not disagreement.
//! - **An orphan member is skipped entirely**, never offered standalone. A
//!   fragment whose opening prompt misrepresents itself is worse than no
//!   trace.
//! - **The hash covers the whole group** (`group_session_hash`), so the
//!   uploader's re-hash guard refuses an approval that no longer describes
//!   the bytes -- membership changes included. Members are sorted by raw
//!   file-name bytes because `read_dir` order is unspecified and both
//!   `entry_id_for` and `submission_id_for` derive from this hash: a
//!   non-deterministic hash would re-offer every group forever.
//! - **A group with no members hashes exactly as the bare file does**, so
//!   adopting grouping does not churn the queue for conversations that
//!   never delegated anything.
