//! The consent surface's words, in one place, for all three shells.
//!
//! Three sentences, and the highest-value three in the app: they are the
//! safety claim shown at the instant of consent, above an irreversible
//! button. They stood as four literals in each shell, because every shell
//! also kept its own copy of the branch that picks between the two help
//! sentences; [`gate_help`] is that fourth literal's replacement, and it is
//! not a sentence. Until this module existed the claim was written three
//! times --
//! `windows/src/TraceCommons.Interop/ReadGate.cs`,
//! `macos/Sources/TCShellCore/ReadGate.swift` and the GTK shell's
//! `copy.rs` -- and held together by a Rust test that opened the other two
//! shells' source files and grepped them for the exact text. That scaffold
//! is O(n) hand-written needles and only ever covered the sentences
//! somebody remembered to add.
//!
//! Not to be confused with `crate::consent`, which validates upload-claim
//! consent scopes and holds no copy at all.
//!
//! # What crosses the boundary
//!
//! The sentences cross already assembled, and so does the *branch*. A shell
//! does not receive two help sentences and choose between them: it calls
//! [`gate_help`] -- across the ABI, `tc_consent_gate_help` -- and receives
//! the chosen one. Three native copies of a two-way branch drift apart
//! silently while every string they return stays identical, which is the
//! failure this module exists to remove.
//!
//! GTK links this crate directly and re-exports these names; the macOS and
//! Windows shells reach them through `tc_consent_copy` and
//! `tc_consent_gate_help`.

/// The sentence that replaced the acknowledgement checkbox.
///
/// `Contribute` used to wait on three things: a pinned preview, the
/// "Exactly what would be sent" text having been on screen, and an
/// acknowledgement ticked by hand. Two of them are gone -- the checkbox as
/// friction, and the transcript-shown condition with it, because a queue
/// row's Submit approves the same session with no preview opened at all, so
/// the gate never stood between anybody and a blind approval.
///
/// What the checkbox *said* is not gone. It is this sentence, and it keeps
/// both halves of what the old gate was honest about: scrubbing is
/// pattern-based and may have missed something, and nothing in the app can
/// tell whether anyone read anything. Do not shorten it for layout; change
/// the layout.

/// An approval binds to the envelope a preview pinned, and a preview built

/// approval to cover. Saying that beats a button that fails when pressed.
///
/// # The divergence this sentence settles
///
/// Windows said this ("This device isn't connected yet...") and macOS said
/// something else ("This preview hasn't loaded yet, so there is nothing
/// here to contribute.") -- two shells, two different explanations of why
/// the same button is off, because the two shells were also testing two
/// different conditions. This wording is the one that survived, for two
/// reasons: it names the condition both shells now test (an enrolled,
/// pinned preview), and the GTK shell already prints a near-identical
/// sentence in `UNENROLLED_PREVIEW`, so choosing it leaves one story rather
/// than two. The macOS condition moved to match; see the migration plan's
/// Task 7.

/// machine.
///
/// No version field, deliberately. A version implies a shell that can serve
/// two of them, and the cdylib and the shell ship together in one DMG, one
/// MSIX, one Flatpak. What is actually needed -- detection of a field that
/// stopped being exported -- is what each shell's refuse-on-any-empty-field
