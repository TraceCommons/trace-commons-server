//! The routing surface's words, in one place, for all three shells.
//!
//! This module used to be a region of the GTK shell's `copy.rs`. It is here
//! because the same surface is now rendered by three shells, and a word kept
//! in three places is three words that have not diverged *yet*. GTK links
//! this crate directly; the macOS and Windows shells reach it across the C
//! ABI through `tc_routing_copy` and the sentence exports beside it.
//!
//! # What crosses the boundary, and what does not
//!
//! Both the vocabulary and the sentences cross, and the sentences cross
//! **already assembled**. Nothing here is handed to a shell as a template
//! with a hole in it: `{path}`, `{port}` and the time are filled in on this
//! side, by the functions below, and a shell receives finished text.
//!
//! That is the whole point. A template a shell fills in is a fourth place
//! the wording can drift -- three shells' worth of format calls, each free
//! to add a word, drop a full stop, or reorder the clause around the hole,
//! and no test anywhere that would notice. Sentences assembled here are
//! covered by [`the_tools_surface_says_nothing_it_should_not`], which
//! renders them and sweeps the result.
//!
//! The single thing that does not cross is the *humanised timestamp* --
//! "an hour ago", "yesterday". That is a rendering of a `DateTime`, not
//! wording about routing, and every shell already has a localised one.
//! [`last_checked_line`] takes it as a string and owns the sentence around
//! it, so "Last checked" is still written once.

// --- Tools -------------------------------------------------------------
//
// One tool, one word.
//
// TOOLS-SURFACE-BEGIN
//
// Everything between this marker and TOOLS-SURFACE-END is swept by
// `the_tools_surface_says_nothing_it_should_not`, which reads this file
// rather than a hand-kept list of names. A string literal added anywhere in
// this region is checked automatically; one added outside it is not.
//
// A contributor running IronWire has one question to answer about each of
// their tools: is IronWire handling it. "Destination", "backend", "route"
// and "proxy" are our vocabulary for the mechanism, and none of them is a
// thing this person has to learn in order to answer it. The controls
// underneath the words are the exception rather than the front door: the
// conventional port is already filled in and the folder box is for an
// unusual install.
//
// # The one word that claims privacy
//
// Exactly one word here -- `TOOL_PRIVATE` -- makes a privacy claim, and no
// word denies one. What backs the claim, and the gap under it, is written
// out on that constant; read it before touching any of these four.
//
// The claim is made only from IronWire's own per-tool answer. The word this
// surface printed before was computed from a single switch declaring
// IronWire in *this* app, which was wrong twice over: it was not per-tool
// -- declaring IronWire here has no causal relation to whether Codex is
// configured to send through it -- and it had no third state, so a dead
// proxy and an unlisted tool both rendered as a confident verdict.

pub const TOOLS_HEADING: &str = "Tools";

/// IronWire answered, and reports this tool as pointed at a local address.
///
/// # What this word claims, and the gap under it
///
/// "Private" is what a contributor came here to learn, and naming the
/// vendor instead tells them nothing they can act on. So this is the word.
///
/// Be clear-eyed about what backs it. IronWire reports a tool as wired when
/// its config names **any loopback host, on any port, with the path
/// `/anthropic`** -- deliberately, so `ironwire connect` can follow a port
/// change. Nothing on that response carries a port or a URL, so this app
/// cannot today distinguish IronWire from some other local proxy answering
/// on the same path. In that configuration this word would be wrong.
///
/// That configuration is unusual, and the alternative -- printing a vendor
/// name and leaving the person to work out whether it means their code is
/// exposed -- is worse for every ordinary case. The gap closes properly
/// when IronWire exposes either the URL a tool points at or a `wired`
/// computed against the running port; the ask is with them, and
/// `points_at_us` already parses that port and discards it.
///

/// reach.

/// cannot see; the second was not per-tool at all. What is left is what the
/// evidence supports: a record on this machine is read, per tool, and the
/// answer is about the first hop.
///
/// # Why the proxy is not a character here
///
/// It used to be. The vendor ran, answered, kept files and had a name, and
/// a contributor had to learn all of that before they could read a single
/// word about their own tools. This surface now has exactly two actors --
/// this app, and the contributor's tools -- and the proxy appears only as
/// what it is to us: a record kept on this machine that we can read or
/// cannot. Nothing below names a vendor, and
/// [`the_tools_surface_says_nothing_it_should_not`] holds that.
