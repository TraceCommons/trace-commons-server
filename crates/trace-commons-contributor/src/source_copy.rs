//! What the settings screen says about each tool's sessions, in one place,
//! for all three shells.
//!
//! This is the neighbour of [`crate::routing_copy`] and it exists for the
//! same reason: the sentence below was written out three times -- once in
//! the GTK shell, once in the Windows view model, once in the macOS view --
//! and two of the three were wrong in the same way.
//!
//! # The bug this module exists to remove
//!
//! `get_settings` reports `*_root_configured`, which is `mode == "watch"`.
//! It is therefore **false for both `off` and `unset`**, and a shell that
//! branches on it prints one sentence for two different facts:
//!
//! - `unset` -- nobody was asked. What happens then is the adapter's own
//!   [`crate::source::Undeclared`] policy: `claude-code` and `codex` watch
//!   the conventional location, so sessions ARE being read and "read from
//!   the usual place" is true of them; `gemini-cli` and `cline` construct
//!   no adapter at all and open nothing. One sentence for both would be
//!   false for one of them whichever one it claimed.
//! - `off` -- the contributor said they do not use this tool. No adapter is
//!   constructed and there is no fallback. Nothing is read. The same
//!   sentence is a **false statement in the fail-open direction**, on the
//!   one screen somebody checks to confirm a tool is not being read.
//!
//! `*_source_mode` carries the three-way answer, is already on the wire
//! (`daemon/ipc.rs`'s `redacted_settings`) and is already parsed by all
//! three shells. Nothing here needs a protocol change; it needs the words
//! to branch on the mode instead of on the boolean.
//!
//! # The mirror-image bug, which is worse
//!
//! `unset` is not "declared nothing" for every tool. For `claude-code` and
//! `codex` it is a live scan of the contributor's real home
//! (`source::Undeclared::Conventional`). Telling that contributor nothing is
//! being read would be false in the fail-*closed* direction, which is the
//! worse of the two. So `unset` branches on the adapter's policy rather
//! than being one sentence, and
//! [`the_modes_never_share_a_sentence`] pins that every sentence a tool can
//! render stays distinct from the others.
//!
//! # What crosses the boundary
//!
//! Finished sentences, assembled here, exactly as `routing_copy` does it.
//! The tool's name is interpolated on this side from
//! [`crate::routing_copy`]'s own tool words, so a shell cannot pass
//! "Claude" and get a fourth spelling of the product's name. GTK links this
//! crate; macOS and Windows call `tc_source_check_line`.

/// declaration this build cannot see. Falling back to the `off` sentence
/// there would tell a contributor nothing is read from a tool that is being
/// scanned. Falling back to the `unset` sentence is the pre-existing
/// behaviour and claims no privacy for the tools whose undeclared policy is

///
/// For a `Nothing`-policy tool the fallback does claim that nothing is
