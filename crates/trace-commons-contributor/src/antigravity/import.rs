//! The `import-antigravity` command: list the running IDE's conversations,
//! keep the ones belonging to this project, convert them to Trajectory-v1,
//! and stage them where the existing `trajectory` source will find them.
//!
//! Staging goes to the `trajectories` folder inside the contributor state
//! directory -- the same `Scope::Staging` the `trajectory` source already
//! reads. Never the contributor's project: a trace file dropped into a repo
//! is a file somebody eventually commits.
//!
//! **An empty import is never silent.** Filtering happens at listing time,
//! on `workspaceUri`, before anything is fetched, and every conversation
//! turned away is counted. Without that count `import --project .` in a
//! directory Antigravity has never seen produces exactly the output it
//! produces when the IDE has no conversations at all, and the contributor
//! has no way to tell a mis-scoped run from an empty one. That
//! indistinguishability is the defect this command exists to avoid, so the
//! counts are part of the contract, not decoration.
//!
//! **A partial import is not silent either.** Conversations are staged as
//! the loop runs, and the staging directory is auto-discovered by the
//! trajectory source, so a run that dies halfway has still collected
//! files that a later bare `submit` will offer. Reporting only the error
//! would leave the contributor believing nothing happened, which is worse
//! than the empty-run case: they would be offered work they were never
//! told was collected. Every run therefore yields an [`ImportOutcome`]
//! carrying both what was staged and the failure that stopped it, and the
//! command prints the counts before surfacing the error.
//!
//! Filtering is on `workspaceUri` and fetching is on `cascadeId` -- see
//! [`super::client`] for why those two identifiers must not be confused.
//!
//! The endpoint's port and CSRF token are live credentials. Nothing here
//! formats an [`Endpoint`], and every API failure arrives already collapsed
//! to a fixed label by `client`/`endpoint`, so neither can reach an error,
//! a log line, or the `--json` output.
