//! Fetching the provider's receipt for one inference call.
//!
//! `GET {base}/signature/{chat_id}?model={model}&signing_algo=ed25519` returns
//! the enclave's EIP-191 signature over `<requestHash>:<responseHash>`. This
//! module is the only thing in the tree that calls it. Ed25519, because that
//! signer is the one an attestation report binds -- specifically the
//! `provider_tee` key in the served model's own `model_attestations` entry;
//! the ECDSA signer appears in no ed25519 attestation.
//!
//! # Why the contributor fetches it
//!
//! Three facts decide this, and together they leave one place it can live.
//!
//! - **Only this machine has the identifier.** `chat_id` is
//!   [`RoutedExchange::upstream_id`](super::RoutedExchange::upstream_id),
//!   which exists in the local proxy's SQLite ledger and nowhere else. The
//!   server never sees it and could not ask for it without being told, at
//!   which point it is a caller-supplied identifier rather than a recorded
//!   one.
//! - **The receipt has to arrive with the submission.** The witness verifies
//!   it against the raw bodies *before* redaction, because redaction destroys
//!   the attested bytes. A receipt fetched later has nothing left to verify
//!   against.
//! - **The receipt is not a secret and not a credential.** It is a signature
//!   over two hashes. Fetching it on the contributor's machine leaks nothing
//!   the contributor does not already hold.
//!
//! # What the fetch itself discloses
//!
//! The receipt's *contents* leak nothing. The **request** does: a `GET` for a
//! `chat_id` tells the provider that this client is preparing to submit that
//! specific exchange somewhere, at this moment, from this address. That is a
//! disclosure the inference call alone did not make -- the provider already
//! knew the call happened, and now learns it is being contributed.
//!
//! Nothing here can avoid it while the receipt has to arrive with the
//! submission, and the disclosure goes to the party that already served the
//! call rather than to a new one. It is recorded because a contributor
//! choosing to enable attested submission should be told what the choice
//! costs, not because it is mitigated.
//!
//! The alternative -- the witness fetching it -- fails on the first point and
//! adds an egress dependency to an enclave whose whole design is that it
//! talks to as little as possible.
//!
//! # The model is a query parameter here, and query parameters are not signed
//!
//! The endpoint requires `model`, and the value this module sends is chosen by
//! whoever fetches: it is not covered by any signature and establishes
//! nothing on its own. It is sent because the endpoint demands it.
//!
//! The **receipt** is a different matter. A hosted model answers with the
//! three-part form, `{model}:{requestHash}:{responseHash}`, whose leading part
//! *is* signed -- so the receipt names its own model, and that is the name the
//! attestation check below looks a signer set up by.
//!
//! # Failure is absence
//!
//! Every error resolves to no receipt. A submission without one is honestly
//! unattested; a witness that requires attestation refuses it by name. There
//! is no partial success and nothing here can fail a submission.
//!
//! # Nothing here is logged
//!
//! The identifier, the model, the base URL and the receipt fields are all
//! caller data. [`ReceiptFetchError`] is label-only.
