//! The private-inference surface's words, in one place, for all three shells.
//!
//! `private_inference` starts a listener on this machine that answers the
//! model calls a contributor's tools make. Task 2 shipped the switch and the
//! state it reports; this module is every sentence printed about either, so
//! that the offer, the settings row and the state lines are written
//! once rather than three times.
//!
//! # What crosses the boundary
//!
//! The same contract [`crate::routing_copy`] states: both the vocabulary and
//! the sentences cross, and the sentences cross **already assembled**. The
//! one interpolated sentence here -- [`serving_line`] -- is finished on this
//! side from a port number, not handed to a shell as a template. A template a
//! shell fills in is a fourth place the wording can drift.
//!
//! The branch tables cross too. [`state_line`], [`state_tone`],
//! [`should_offer`], [`write_confirmed`] and [`quit_needs_notice`] each own a
//! shared decision, and each of
//! them is the kind of `switch` that has historically been written out again
//! in Swift, in C# and in Rust, and then disagreed in silence.
//!
//! # The words this surface may not use
//!
//! Swept by `the_offer_surface_says_nothing_it_should_not`: no vendor name,
//! no "proxy"/"backend"/"route", and -- the important one -- no claim of
//! privacy, safety or encryption. Turning this on does not make a
//! contributor's calls private. It moves where they are answered from and
//! keeps the record here; each call still goes on to whoever was configured
//! to answer it. The setting's internal name says "private" and this surface
//! must not repeat it as a promise.
