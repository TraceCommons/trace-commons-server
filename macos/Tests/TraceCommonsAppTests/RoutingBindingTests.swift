/// How `SettingsView`'s routing card is wired to the surface underneath it.
///
/// `RoutingSurfaceTests` proves the mapping, `RoutingSurfaceExportTests`
/// proves the words, and `RoutingCallTests` proves the bytes. None of the
/// three can see the layer between them and a contributor: which property
/// each control is bound to. A card that read `form.on` to decide a tool's
/// word, or disabled the port field on the wrong sense of the switch, would
/// pass all three suites and ship the defect this surface was rebuilt to
/// remove.
///
/// A SwiftUI `body` holding `@State` and an `@EnvironmentObject` cannot be
/// built, rendered or reflected outside a running window, so these assert
/// against the view's own source. That is a real limitation and worth
/// naming: they catch a binding pointed at the wrong property, and they do
/// not catch a layout that never puts the control on screen. They are
/// written to fail loudly rather than silently -- every locator below
/// reports the text it was looking in when it does not find what it needs,
/// so a refactor that moves this card produces a failure to fix and not a
/// test that quietly stops asserting.

/// The Rust-side calls as the app wires them. Spelled here rather than taken
/// from `AppModel` so these assertions do not need a live model.
