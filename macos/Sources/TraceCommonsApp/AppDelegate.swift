/// The pieces of app behaviour that SwiftUI does not own.
///
/// There was no delegate here at all while the app was `LSUIElement`, and it
/// did not need one: a menu-bar-only app has no App menu, no Cmd-Tab entry,
/// no Dock menu and no reopen event, so the only way into anything was the
/// menu the app drew itself. Becoming a regular app opens all of those at
/// once, and each is a path into behaviour that previously had exactly one
/// entrance.
///
/// Three of those paths need answering, and they are the reason this type
/// exists rather than three separate accommodations:
///
/// - **Quit** now arrives from the App menu, Cmd-Q and the Dock icon's
///   context menu, none of which SwiftUI routes through the menu-bar item's
///   "Quit…" command. `applicationShouldTerminate` is the one funnel every
///   one of them passes through.
/// - **Reopen** (clicking the Dock icon with no window open) does nothing at
///   all without a delegate, which reads as a hang.
/// - **URL events** are delivered here, above any view. `onOpenURL` fires
///   only on a mounted view, and the app's resting state is running with no
///   window, so a view-level handler drops every link that arrives in the
///   state contributors are actually in.

        // The obvious heuristic does not work. A login item is started by
        // launchd, so `getppid() == 1` looks like it identifies one -- but
        // every GUI launch is reparented to launchd, including a Finder
        // double-click and `open`. Measured: launching this bundle with
        // `open` gives ppid 1 and is indistinguishable from a login start.
        // An earlier draft of this file used that test and hid the app on
        // every launch.
        //
        // SMAppService.mainApp offers no launch-hidden flag and no "you were
        // started at login" signal, so rather than guess, launch behaviour is
        // uniform: come up quietly, exactly as this app always has. That is
        // the correct answer at login -- the contributor agreed to "Start
        // Trace Commons when you log in?", which is a promise to be running,
        // not a request to be greeted -- and a recoverable one everywhere
        // else, because there is now a Dock icon, and clicking it opens the
        // window through applicationShouldHandleReopen below.
