import SwiftUI

/// Chains the existing onboarding screens into one first-run flow.
///
/// Each screen already exists (`OnboardingWelcomeView`, `OnboardingRootsView`,
/// `OnboardingConnectView`, `ConsentScopesView`, `OnboardingPrivacyScanView`,
/// `OnboardingProjectsView`, `OnboardingDoneView`) and drives its own daemon
/// call. This view owns only the sequencing between them and the one piece
/// of state that must survive a screen change: the consent scopes chosen on
/// the consent screen, which the screens after it must not discard if the
/// contributor goes back to revisit them.
///
/// ## The roots screen comes second, not first
///
/// On a fresh install the daemon refuses to start until the session roots
/// are declared (`AppModel.Startup.needsRoots`), and the roots screen is
/// what clears that. It used to be rendered directly on that state, so the
/// first thing a new contributor ever saw was "Which folders may this app
/// watch?" -- a consent question asked before the screen that says what the
/// app is and why it wants anything. Welcome now comes first on that path
/// too; `Get started` goes to the roots screen while the daemon is still
/// refusing and straight to Connect once it is running. The roots screen
/// needs no daemon, so nothing about it changes by moving it.
///
/// Returning contributors whose folder declarations were lost repeat Welcome,
/// folder consent, and the remaining setup. Existing enrollment remains valid.
///
/// ## Call ordering (why `enroll` carries no scopes)
///
/// The contract's `enroll` entry (`docs/contributor-daemon-ipc-v1_1.md`)
/// accepts an optional `scopes` array at enroll time. That would be the
/// simpler wire sequence -- one call instead of two -- but it does not fit
/// this product's fixed screen order: screen 2 (Connect, which fires
/// `enroll`) comes *before* screen 3 (the actual consent decision). Asking
/// `OnboardingConnectView` to somehow carry screen 3's answer backward in
/// time is not an option, so this coordinator does the opposite: `enroll`
/// runs with no `scopes` (the daemon then applies the floor scope,
/// `debugging_evaluation`, only), and screen 3's `Continue` calls
/// `set_consent_scopes` -- a separate, local-only, already-enrolled-only
/// call built for exactly this -- to apply what the contributor actually
/// chose. `set_consent_scopes` requires an existing enrollment, which
/// `enroll` on screen 2 has, by this point, already established.
///
/// ## Atomicity: what is atomic, what is resumable
///
/// Each daemon call in this flow (`enroll`, `set_consent_scopes`,
/// `acknowledge_near_ai_notice`, `set_project_mode`) is individually
/// atomic: it either lands on the daemon or it visibly fails, and this
/// coordinator does not advance past a failed one silently (see
/// `advanceFromConsent`).
///
/// The onboarding *sequence* is deliberately NOT atomic -- there is no
/// wire-level transaction spanning `enroll` through the Done screen, and
/// there could not be one without a contract change this task is not
/// permitted to make. What makes that safe is that the two states an
/// interrupted contributor can be found in are told apart, not conflated:
///
/// - Not yet enrolled (`status.logged_in == false`): show onboarding from
///   the top (`Welcome`).
/// - Enrolled but onboarding not finished (`status.logged_in == true` and
///   `AppModel.isOnboardingComplete == false`, a local marker this
///   coordinator sets only when the Done screen's button is pressed): show
///   onboarding resumed at the Consent screen -- `enroll` already ran, so
///   there is nothing to redo there, but nothing past it is trustworthy
///   yet.
/// - Enrolled and onboarding finished: show the main window.
///
/// This is what keeps a crash or quit between `enroll` and Done from ever
/// landing a contributor in the main window with an unset (floor-only)
/// consent choice they never actually confirmed -- the forbidden outcome.
/// `TraceCommonsAppMain`/`MainWindowView` is what reads `isOnboardingComplete`
/// to make that branch; this view only needs `startAt` to know where in the
/// sequence to resume.
