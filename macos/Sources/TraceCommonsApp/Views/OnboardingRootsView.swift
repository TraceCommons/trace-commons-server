/// The roots screen: which session folders this app may watch.

/// It runs BEFORE the daemon starts, and therefore before any IPC exists --
/// which is why it makes no daemon call of its own (the coordinator
/// sequences it between Welcome and Connect, but nothing on it is
/// daemon-backed) and why it is not the "What to watch" screen. That screen
/// lists projects the
/// daemon has already discovered and sets a per-project mode; it is
/// downstream of a scan. This one decides whether a scan may happen at all.
///
/// The product had a fully designed six-screen onboarding flow with no
/// screen that asked this question, which is why nothing in any client could
/// write `daemon-settings.json` and why the macOS shell's roots refusal was
/// a dead end: the only screens that could clear it lived behind the daemon
/// it was blocking.
///
/// ## Discovery is not consent
///
/// `tc_discover_sources` finds the conventional stores and describes them --
/// where, whether they are there, how many sessions, how recently touched --
/// so the contributor is answering about "953 sessions, most recent 2 hours
/// ago" instead of filling an empty field from memory. That is a better
/// question, not a substitute for asking it: **nothing is pre-selected**.
/// Every row opens undecided and needs one deliberate action.
///
/// A pre-ticked row plus a habitual Continue records consent nobody gave --
/// the same objection that rules out migrating existing installs by writing
/// the roots they were implicitly watching.
///
/// ## Why declining has its own button
///
/// "I don't use this" writes `{"mode":"off"}`. Leaving a row blank would be
/// read by the daemon as the conventional location -- the contributor's real
/// `~/.codex/sessions` -- so the one answer a blank field cannot give is the
/// one a contributor who does not use that agent needs to give.
