/// ## Why this screen is built differently from every other one
///
/// It is drawn in the COMMUNITY brand rather than in the native token layer,
/// and that seam is deliberate. `design-import/DESIGN-SPEC.md` section 5.8
/// moves the site's hero language into the first-run window: a 2px ink frame
/// around a white page, Helvetica, display type at landing scale (uppercase,
/// tight tracking, .88 line height), the promise line carried on the mint
/// highlight the site uses for live nav, mono uppercase micro-labels, and the
/// wireframe globe. Everywhere past this flow the app is the quiet native
/// tool; this is the one frame that speaks in the commons' voice, because the
/// argument being made here is the commons' argument, not the tool's.
///
/// The globe is STILL. Section 4.5's one-motion rule says the only animation
/// in the desktop app is the mark's own assembly, which is what
/// `BrandMarkIntro` in the header bar is; the globe "only turns on the
/// website".
///
/// ## Copy
///
/// Every sentence is the spec's, unchanged. One is MOVED: "You decide what
/// gets contributed. Nothing is sent unless you say so." was set bold inside
/// the second paragraph, where it was the most important claim on the screen
/// and the least likely to be read. It is now the headline, which is what
/// bold inside a paragraph was trying and failing to do. The paragraph it
/// came from still reads as a complete sentence without it.
///
/// The scrubbing concession -- "That scrubbing is good and it is not perfect
/// -- which is why you get to look first" -- stays verbatim, stays on this
/// screen, and is not demoted into the small print. It is what makes every
/// later claim credible.

    /// ## Why this is a ladder and not one layout
    ///
    /// The spec states the headline at 50pt. Measured (`NSAttributedString`
    /// with Helvetica Neue Bold at `heroTrackingEm`), its longest line, "YOU
    /// DECIDE WHAT GETS CONTRIBUTED.", is **948pt** wide at 50pt. The brand
    /// page is 860pt on its widest canvas and the globe takes 230 of it, so
    /// that line does not fit beside the globe at 50pt in any window this app
    /// can open -- not at the spec's own canvas size. It is not a matter of
    /// the window being too small today; the number does not work.
    ///
    /// So the size is chosen rather than asserted. `ViewThatFits` walks the
    /// ladder below and takes the first rung whose stated width fits, and
    /// every rung's column width is the measured width of that longest line
    /// at that size (plus the 4pt highlight padding on each side). Because
    /// each rung declares an explicit width, its ideal size is exact and the
    /// choice is made in one layout pass -- which also means it works under
    /// `ImageRenderer`, where a `GeometryReader`-plus-state approach would
    /// render at the default and never update.
    ///
    /// ## What the hero can actually be
    ///
    /// The page is capped at the spec's 860pt canvas, and section 5.8 spends
    /// that on `margin:0 18px 18px` (36), the 2px frame (4) and `padding:12px`
    /// (24), leaving 796 inside the frame and 780 across the hero after its
    /// own 8pt inset. So 780 -- not 860, and nowhere near 948 -- is the widest
    /// the headline can ever be, on any display.
    ///
    /// That is what forces the one deviation from section 5.8's arrangement.
    /// The spec puts headline, lede and button together in a left column with
    /// the globe in a right column, which means the headline pays for the
    /// globe's 230pt out of its own measure. The line breaks are fixed by the
    /// copy -- "You decide what gets contributed." is one line whatever the
    /// column does -- so a narrower column cannot make that line need less
    /// width; it can only make the type smaller. Sharing the column costs
    /// roughly a third of the headline's size, and at the narrower canvas it
    /// costs the globe entirely.
    ///
    /// So the headline spans the full measure and the split starts underneath
    /// it: the lede and the button on the left, the globe on the right, still
    /// a two-column hero with the illustration on the right. That is the only
    /// arrangement in which both survive at these widths, and it is why the
    /// globe is back at every size.
    ///
    /// The headline ladder (measured widths, `+8` for the highlight padding):
    ///
    ///     size   width   fits
