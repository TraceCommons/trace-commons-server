/// "## Onboarding", "### 2. Connect"), not paraphrased.
///
/// "Resolve and show the instance before committing" is done entirely
/// client-side: an invite link is `https://issuer.example/onboard#CODE` (see
/// `parse_invite` in `crates/trace-commons-contributor/src/commands.rs`), so
/// the issuer host is visible the moment the link is parsed, with no network
/// round trip and no separate daemon method. Only the `enroll` call itself
/// -- fired once the person taps to actually join -- touches the network.
///
/// The daemon's `enroll` never echoes the underlying HTTP condition back
/// over the socket; any failure it reports is the generic `unavailable` /
/// `enroll-failed` (see "### `enroll`" in
/// `docs/contributor-daemon-ipc-v1_1.md`). So this view has exactly one
/// failure sentence for the whole invite path, and shows it verbatim
/// regardless of what the daemon actually said -- surfacing the raw code
/// would tell an onlooker more than it would tell the contributor.
