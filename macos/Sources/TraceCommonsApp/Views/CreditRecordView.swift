/// 5.9.1. Copy is verbatim.
///
/// Credit is a **record**, not a currency: no currency symbol, no fiat
/// estimate, no projection, no date, no streaks, no leaderboards, no
/// progress rings. The audience is developers giving away work product;
/// gamifying it insults them and makes the speculative framing look like
/// manipulation. `lastRefreshedAt == nil` renders as "Not synced yet", never
/// a confident `0.0`.
///
/// The card carries the community site's coin as its emblem -- mint face,
/// ink linework, `#00b894` rim -- because the coin is what a contributor has
/// already seen on the site, and the card's job is to say plainly that the
/// thing behind that emblem is a receipt. It is held STILL here: the
/// one-motion rule (spec section 4.5) gives the desktop app exactly one
/// animation, the mark's assembly, and "the coin only turns on the website".
/// The face carries no `$`. Section 5.9.1's frame draws one, but section
/// 7.3's standing rule is that no currency symbol appears in the native UI
/// and the `$` lives only on the website's coin -- which is why the card's
/// own coin face carries no glyph.
///
/// A single reusable view rather than two copies, since the two call sites
/// (onboarding and `HistoryView`) must never drift on this wording.
