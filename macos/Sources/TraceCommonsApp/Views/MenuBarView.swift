/// The menu-bar item.
///
/// The mark, not a tray glyph. A menu bar holds twenty icons drawn from the
/// same SF Symbol set and a generic tray is not findable among them; The Turn
/// is, and it is the same mark every other piece of this product's chrome
/// carries, which is the point.
///
/// It is the mark's **template** variant, at the 15pt the design spec states
/// for the macOS menu bar (`design-import/DESIGN-SPEC.md` sections 1.2 and
/// 1.3): frameless, single ink, drawn in `.primary` so the system recolours
/// it across the menu bar's light, dark and selected states the way a
/// template image behaves. The frame is dropped because a hairline rectangle
/// does not survive 15pt next to the system's own glyphs, and the brackets
/// thicken from 7/64 to 8/64 to carry the mark without it.
///
/// State precedence is unchanged from the shared design: decisions owed
/// (numeric badge) -> unhealthy -> paused -> idle, decided in
/// `MenuBarStatus` where it can be tested. The badge counts DECISIONS OWED;
/// if it shows 3, there are exactly three things to say yes or no to. Every
/// state that is not "idle" carries a second glyph as well as a count,
/// because a dimmed mark on its own is not a state anybody can read.
///
/// The count is ON the mark, not beside it. A bare number in the menu bar
/// belongs to nothing -- twenty status items along, a "3" is not findable
/// as this product's "3" -- so it is a capsule over the mark's top right
/// corner, the way an app badge sits on a Dock icon. It was tried under the
/// mark first: 15pt of mark plus a digit row anyone can read is more than
/// the 22pt the menu bar has, and shrinking the mark to make room defeats
/// the reason it is there. See `TC.MenuBar` and `MenuBarGlyph`.
