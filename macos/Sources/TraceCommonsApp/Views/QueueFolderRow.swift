/// `Submit all` -- so the line read as a button with a caption rather than
/// as a place with actions. At 149 waiting sessions that inversion is the
/// difference between a list you can scan and one you cannot.
///
/// `Open` is the row's primary action and the only accented control on it.
/// `Submit all` is a peer, untinted, for the reason the card's `Submit` is:
/// the one-click design says Submit is not the primary action, and a filled
/// `Submit all` on the folder row was recommending exactly what the card
/// below it declines to recommend.
///
/// `Submit all` is shown at EVERY count, including one. The old rule hid it
/// at one because the row's own `Submit` was on the same screen and did the
/// same thing. Under drill-in it is a level down, so hiding it here would
/// mean opening a folder to do the thing the folder is offering. The rule
/// expired with the layout it was written for.
