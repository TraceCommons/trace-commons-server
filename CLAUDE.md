# Repository Guidance — trace-commons-server

This file pins repo-specific facts that override the global CLAUDE.md guidance.

## What this repo is

`trace-commons-server` is the **standalone hosted server-side control plane for
Trace Commons / TraceCommons**. It is no longer part of Ironclaw — extracted from
Ironclaw's `gecko-pass` worktree and now owns its own database schema, object
storage, encrypted artifact store, upload-claim issuer, and shared protocol
crate. Ironclaw should depend on `crates/trace-commons-protocol` when the
client-side integration is rewired, but it does not live in this tree.

There is **no Ironclaw path dependency**. Do not look for one. Do not propose
adding one.

## Database backend

This repo is **PostgreSQL-only**. There is no libsql build configuration.

The global CLAUDE.md guidance to "verify ALL relevant feature flags compile
cleanly (e.g., both postgres and libsql builds)" does **not** apply here. A
single `cargo check -p trace-commons-server` is sufficient. Do not add libsql
feature flags, do not propose dual-backend testing, do not run libsql-specific
verification.

## Where to look

- `README.md` — current phase status, open production gaps, operator promotion
  checklist. Lead with this when orienting on the repo.
- `docs/trace-commons.md` — envelope contract and threat model (authoritative).
- `docs/trace-commons-storage.md` — storage contract (authoritative).
- `docs/trace-commons-roadmap.md` — the production-gap queue and phase plan.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` — per-slice design specs.
- `docs/superpowers/plans/` — per-slice implementation plans.
- `docs/operator/README.md` — operator runbook index. Current runbooks:
  A2.6 result handler, pilot-bootstrap first-100-traces, HF cache hygiene,
  GPU cost ledger.

When in doubt about what to build next, read the **"Production Gap Queue"**
section of the roadmap.

## Binaries

- `trace-commons-ingest` — hosted ingest / review / admin / worker API.
- `trace-commons-upload-claim-issuer` — EdDSA/Ed25519 upload-claim issuer.
- `trace-commons-gate-calibrate` — calibration tooling. Subcommands include
  `tail-floor --sidecar <path> --db-url <url> --percentile <n>` for tail-floor
  calibration, and the scorer flags `--scorer perplexity|token-rarity|both`
  with `--token-rarity-k <N>` for per-token rarity. The real-scorer path
  (`LocalPerplexityScorer`) is deferred at `BakeoffRealRarityNotImplemented`
  pending A.5a.

## Local development

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check -p trace-commons-server --bins
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo test -p trace-commons-server --no-run
cargo clippy -p trace-commons-server --all-targets -- \
  -A clippy::type_complexity -A clippy::collapsible_if \
  -A clippy::manual_option_as_slice -A clippy::useless_vec \
  -A clippy::redundant_pattern_matching
cargo test -p trace-commons-server --test trace_corpus_storage_contract
cargo test -p trace-commons-server --test trace_corpus_pg_store   # requires PostgreSQL
```

CI applies `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` to check + test, so plain `cargo check`
will not catch what CI catches. Always use the `RUSTFLAGS` form locally
before claiming green. Clippy is CI-enforced — run it locally too.

The protocol crate is `crates/trace-commons-protocol`; the server crate is
`crates/trace-commons-server`. Migrations live in `migrations/`.

## CI

Every job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR. There are twenty
as of 2026-09-06; the list below covers the long-standing ones and is not
a full inventory -- read the workflow for that. (It said "nine" while the
file held fifteen, and "eighteen" while it held twenty, so treat any count
here as stale until re-checked.)

Running is not the same as blocking. **Thirteen** of the twenty are required
status checks on `main`, and only those block a merge -- `README.md` lists
them. `main` is also behind a merge queue (`main merge queue`), so the
required checks are re-run against `main` at merge time; a PR that never
receives them times out of the queue instead of merging.

- `cargo fmt --check` — runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check`. Run `cargo fmt --all`
  before committing.
- `cargo clippy` with the allow-list above (`-A clippy::type_complexity
  -A clippy::collapsible_if -A clippy::manual_option_as_slice
  -A clippy::useless_vec -A clippy::redundant_pattern_matching`). Do not
  widen the allow-list without explicit approval.
- `cargo check (default features)` (with `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`).
- `cargo check (local-gpu-models, non-CUDA)` (with `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`).
  Note this feature IS checked in CI even though it cannot link locally without
  a CUDA toolchain — a change that only compiles under default features will
  fail here.
- `cargo check (near-ai-scorer)` (with `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`). This is the
  configuration the pilot builds.
- `cargo check (permissive crates, standalone)` — builds each MIT/Apache crate
  alone with `--no-default-features`. Every other job builds the workspace or
  the server crate, and cargo unifies features across those, so a permissive
  crate can silently come to need one of this workspace's optional features.
  That is the configuration a third-party harness gets, and this job is the
  only thing that exercises it. See #486.
- `cargo test (default features)` (with `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings`).
- `pilot-bootstrap smoke` — `scripts/operator/pilot-bootstrap-smoke.sh`,
  exercising the JSONL loader path. Do not break it.
- `operator-binaries smoke`.
- `macOS app tests` — `swift test` in `macos/`, on `macos-26`. The only
  thing that runs the Swift suite; before it existed those tests gated
  nothing. Needs `cargo build -p trace-commons-contributor-ffi` first,
  because the Swift package links that dylib.
- `windows named-pipe ACL` — the only `windows-latest` job. Runs
  `scripts/windows/verify-pipe-acl.ps1`, which creates a second,
  non-administrator local account and requires it to be denied when opening
  the contributor daemon's named pipe. That DACL is the sole access control
  on the daemon IPC socket on Windows, and it is not observable from a
  cross-compile, so this job is the only thing standing behind the claim
  that it works. Do not weaken it to a smoke test.

GitHub Actions runners are on Node 24; pinned actions are
`actions/checkout@v6` and `actions/cache@v5`. Future CI edits should hold
those versions unless intentionally upgrading.

## Licensing

This repo is **split-licensed**, and the split is load-bearing. `AGENTS.md`
carries the full statement of it; the essentials are repeated here.

- **AGPL-3.0-or-later**: `trace-commons-server`, `trace-commons-gate-api`,
  `trace-commons-gate-enclave`. Copyright K&Z Partners LLC. Every `.rs` file in
  these crates carries a two-line copyright + SPDX header; new files need one.
- **MIT OR Apache-2.0**: everything else (`-protocol`, `-contributor`,
  `-contributor-ffi`, `-contributor-gtk`, `-operator-client`, `-mark`,
  `-build-info`, `-attestation`). These ship inside proprietary agent harnesses
  and must stay permissive.

**Contributions are licensed inbound under `MIT OR Apache-2.0`**, including to
the AGPL crates -- deliberately not "inbound = outbound", so the project keeps
the right to relicense what it distributes. Stated in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the PR
template, `LICENSE`, and the README; keep those four consistent.

**Permissive code may flow into the AGPL crates. Never the reverse.** Do not add
`trace-commons-gate-api`, `-gate-enclave`, or `-server` to a permissive crate's
dependencies -- not even to reuse a single trait. That silently makes a shipped
client copyleft. `crates/trace-commons-server/tests/license_boundary.rs` fails
if you do; do not "fix" it by editing the expected sets. Test-only
dev-dependencies across the boundary are permitted but pinned in that same file.

Note that `trace-commons-gate-api`'s traits being AGPL is deliberate: the
proprietary-backend seam described below is available to the copyright holder
and closed to third parties. The inbound MIT/Apache term is what keeps that
possible -- an outside contribution offered under other terms would end it.

AGPL section 13 obliges a network operator to offer the Corresponding Source.
`trace-commons-ingest` does this at `GET /v1/source` -- unauthenticated, no
tenant context, outside every fail-closed gate. Do not put it behind auth.

`cargo deny check licenses` audits dependency licenses against `deny.toml`.
`--features` is a **global** flag on `cargo deny`, not a `check` flag -- it goes
before the subcommand. `cargo deny check licenses --features near-ai-scorer`
errors with `unexpected argument '--features' found`. Run all four:

```bash
cargo deny check licenses
cargo deny --features near-ai-scorer check licenses
cargo deny --features local-gpu-models check licenses
cargo deny --all-features check licenses
```

The `--all-features` run is not redundant with the other three: 54 crates
resolve only under it -- the whole `google-cloud-*` tree behind `gcs-client` /
`gcp-kms`, the `cudarc` / `ug-cuda` stack behind `local-gpu-models-cuda`, and
`dcap-qvl`'s collateral client behind `near-attestation-collateral`. Do not
delete it as duplicated coverage.

A new dependency must be combinable into an AGPL-3.0 work: GPL-2.0-only, SSPL,
or proprietary is a hard conflict. CI runs `check licenses` and `check sources`
under `--all-features`, and runs `check advisories` under `--all-features`
too, so the manual runs above are a pre-flight, not the only enforcement.

If the boundary test fails, remove the dependency. Do not edit the expected sets
in `license_boundary.rs` to match your diff -- those sets are the specification.

## Conventions specific to this repo

- **Hash-only audit and logging.** Audit rows, error logs, and operational
  surfaces are hash-only or label-only. Never include raw URLs, bearer tokens,
  ARNs, account references, transaction hashes, contributor identity, trace
  bodies, or any operator-secret material in stored rows or log strings.
- **Fail-closed by default.** When a required gate is configured but its
  dependency is missing, refuse the path with a safe missing-control name.
  Never silently fall back to plaintext or to a less-restricted backend.
- **Tenant scoping.** Every read/write path must be driven by auth-derived
  tenant + actor context. Envelope tenant fields are attribution only.
- **PostgreSQL RLS is forced** on every Trace Commons table. Tenant predicates
  go through `trace_current_tenant_id()`; the raw pool is restricted.
- **No emojis in commits, PRs, code, or reports.** Match the existing commit
  style (short imperative subjects without `feat:` / `fix:` prefixes).
- **Gate contracts live in `trace-commons-gate-api`.** Traits, result types, and
  decision types belong there; scoring implementations do not. Code that holds a
  scorer, embedder, or vector index must hold it as a trait object, never as a
  concrete type — a proprietary backend substitutes at that seam, and a concrete
  type cannot participate in one. The `Reference*` implementations in that crate
  are real but deliberately simple and uncalibrated; the `Mock*` types in
  `trace-commons-gate-enclave` are hash-derived test doubles and must never gate
  anything. See `crates/trace-commons-gate-api/README.md`.

## Working with this codebase

- Files have grown large (e.g. `bin/trace-commons-ingest.rs` is huge). Do not
  unilaterally split files unless a spec asks for it. Add new modules beside
  existing code when possible.
- Worker routes follow a consistent auth pattern — find an existing handler
  and copy its shape rather than inventing a new one.
- Worker-route credentials are scoped: utility, review, retention, vector,
  benchmark, process-evaluation, revocation, export, and revocation-propagation
  each have their own bearer-token gate. Do not mix them.
- Drills (`/v1/admin/*-drill`) produce hash-only evidence and feed rollout-smoke
  required checks. When you add a drill, wire it into the smoke evidence path.
- `crates/trace-commons-server/src/bin/trace-commons-ingest.rs` is ~61k LOC of
  production code. Its ~60k LOC test module has been extracted to a sibling
  file via `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "trace_commons_ingest_internal/tests.rs"] mod
  tests;`. Reuse this pattern if other binaries need the same split; do not
  inline the tests back.
- Pilot-bootstrap loads JSONL session files. Parquet + arrow deps were
  removed; do not reintroduce them. See
  `crates/trace-commons-server/src/bin/pilot_bootstrap/hf_dataset.rs`.

## Known gotchas

- Plain `cargo check` does not apply `-D warnings`; CI does. Always verify
  with `RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo check -p trace-commons-server --bins` and
  `RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings' cargo test -p trace-commons-server --no-run` before
  claiming green. Dead-code and warning regressions slip through plain
  `cargo check`.
- Pilot-bootstrap loader streams JSONL session files; parquet support was
  removed. See `crates/trace-commons-server/src/bin/pilot_bootstrap/hf_dataset.rs`.
- `trace-commons-ingest.rs` test module is extracted to
  `trace_commons_ingest_internal/tests.rs` via `#[path = ...]`.
